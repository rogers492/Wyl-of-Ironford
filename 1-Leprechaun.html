LEPRECHAUN


Again came the morning, with that painful reminder that her love was forever lost.  Though he had to force himself to rise, he was ready to leave within the hour.


Completing his final baggage checks, Wyl stared into the glass jar in his hand, at the lump of rotten flesh wriggling grotesquely within the viscous green fluid, wondering if the legends about it could be true.
He mumbled a prayer to his arcane gods, "I beg ye, preserve the potency of the potion, until I am rid of it."
And, he hoped, rid of it in return for a handsome reward. He recalled that drunken evening at the Happy Fool Inn, almost two moons past, and the hushed words of the old antiquarian, “Yes, that's it, The Tongue of the Undying Warlock.  Must be worth an ox-cart of gold!”


Wyl stuffed the jar into his pack and mounted up.  He enjoyed riding, it made him feel tall, which he was for a gnome, nearly three feet without boots. As he cantered down to the rough road he began to regret the innkeeper's generosity at breakfast.  He stood up in the stirrups and let rip a thunderous fart.
"Ha ha! Warlock, how does that taste upon your wicked tongue?  I've cleared a copper mine or two in my time!" he laughed, as he spurred his mount on.






It was a fine day and a pleasant ride along the forest road, even though the sun was rarely glimpsed between the tall trees.  Wyl rode steadily for several hours, chewing on a crust as he got peckish, or taking a swig of sparkling spring water to slake his thirst.  It was late afternoon before he reached the crossroads to which the innkeeper had directed him.  He took the path to the north, as advised, but it soon became grassy and indistinct as the wood thickened.


As his eyes grew accustomed to the deepening gloom, Wyl noticed wolves prowling around in the shadows.  He rode on more carefully, successfully avoiding the attention of the wolves, until he was stopped short by the sight ahead of a particularly vicious looking alpha male.  He recognised it from a poster at the inn, “Deepfang - wanted dead, in return for a handsome reward.”  The two huge fangs required as proof of the kill were wickedly prominent.  It looked a formidable beast, but it was isolated from the rest of the pack and Wyl was seriously thinking of bagging the kill and claiming the reward on his return journey.  But then he noticed he and the wolf were not alone.  Through the trees beyond Deepfang, stood a troll huntress, her bow aimed directly at Wyl, her trained raptor slavering by her side.
“Horde!” hissed Wyl, under his breath.
Wyl started calculating for the fight; she was outside his spell range so he would have to rush forward, but she was sure to get at least one poisoned or enchanted arrow into him before he could cast.  Even if he immobilised both her and the raptor, she would fire more arrows.  And she may have laid traps, perhaps intended for Deepfang, but they would spring their deadly attacks on Wyl if he triggered them.  No, best just to go for highest rate of damage and hope he outgunned her, he would deal with the pet if he bested the huntress.  But the the huntress suddenly swung her bow in the direction of Deepfang and let the arrow fly.  It was an explosive impact shot that echoed loudly throughout the forest, startling birds and other wildlife.  Deepfang just seemed to shrug it off, growled with rage and turned towards the huntress, but a concussive shot hit him next to leave him momentarily dazed and confused.  By now, the raptor was upon the wolf, leaping up at the canine and slashing with it's terrible claws.  Deepfang awoke from the daze and fought back with a terrible gnashing bite that crushed the raptor's neck, before tossing the dinosaur aside like a bloody rag.  But then a perfectly-aimed, anatomy-dissecting arrow hit home and Deepfang sensed the huntress was his nemesis.  Enraged, he dashed towards her with a frothy, berserk growl and was almost upon the crouching troll when her trap sprung and the nest of irate vipers hissed and struck.  The eyes of the once terrifying pack-leader rolled in consternation even as he snapped back at the snapping snakes, but he grew visibly weaker with each passing second as the venom took effect, until he gave up and cried a final forlorn howl.  Then he whimpered, twitched and staggered, to fall deathly silent at the feet of the huntress.  The snakes hissed away into the undergrowth as the troll observed some brief rite of thanksgiving.   Wyl bowed to the troll and she bowed back.  Still tensed for action, Wyl rode past her as she took out her skinning knife.  At fifty yards range he glanced back; she was busy removing the huge fangs and the hide of the defeated wolf.  Wyl relaxed and continued on his way.


With the excitement over, Wyl noticed that this part of the forest was very quiet. The wonderful forest birdsong, which had been a constant melody over the rhythm of his mount's hooves, was here totally absent. All he could hear was an occasional creak and an eerie wind moving through the branches.


Not entirely sure he was on still on the right path, Wyl dismounted and continued at a slow walk, until a short while later, he arrived at a leafy glade covered in all manner of exotic fungi.  At the centre of the glade stood a particularly large and gnarled old toadstool, that had windows and a wooden door, just as the innkeeper had described it.  Wyl stood at the door and knocked.  After only a moment, the door swung open and a leprechaun grinned up at him.
"Welcome!  Welcome!" he said, stepping out of the toadstool house.
"Thank you and hello," said Wyl.
The leprechaun inhaled a deep breath, "Ah, it's a bootiful day, to be sure."
"Indeed it is," said Wyl.
"Me name is Krackle! I used to be famous t'roughout d' land; me an' my two brudders; maybe you remember us?"
Wyl thought for a moment, but all he could think of right then was breakfast, "Er, sorry..."
"No?  Well, never you mind.  An' who would you be den?"
"I am Wyl of Ironford.”
“Ironforge, eh?  Tis a wonderful place Ironforge, great beer!”
“No, not Ironforge,” Wyl said in a slightly exasperated voice, “Iron… ford.  Don’t worry, it’s a common mistake.  I'm here on an errand for Eweline."
"Well 'oil' be blessed!" said the leprechaun, "An' 'ow is de old witch?"
"She was in good health when I left her, almost seven moons past."
"Ah, good, good. An' what would she be wantin' wi' d' likes o' me good self?"
Wyl took the jar from his backpack and showed the Tongue of the Undying Warlock to the leprechaun, "She asked me to deliver this."
"Begorrah!  Dat is a rare an' powerful artefact, to be sure. But what would I be doin' wi' such a t'ing?"
Wyl was momentarily nonplussed, "Well, er, Eweline said you would know someone who needed it.  So, I was hoping you would give me a good price for it."
"Ah, I see," said the leprechaun, smiling, "Dis is a very special item. I wouldn't vend it if I wuz you. But I can 'elp you find out who needs it."
"Oh, thanks," said Wyl, a little disappointed.
Krackle rummaged in his waist pouch, "Let me see. Ah, 'ere we go. Put d' jar down right dere on d' grass."
Wyl put the jar by Krackle's feet and stepped back.
"A liddle of de right faerie dust," said Krackle, grinning as he spun around while sprinkling something on the grass around the jar.
Instantly, a ring of small flesh-pink toadstools grew up around the jar, "Dere yer go!" said the grinning leprechaun, "Ah, see, we've grown d' 'Maiden's Hood'.  So, wouldn't yer know it, dere's a lady in yer future.  Now den, dat's d' largest," he announced, pointing at a toadstool which was several inches taller than the rest, "So, you will be heading, west!"
Krackle then stooped slightly and plucked the largest toadstool. He sniffed it appreciatively, "Yer know, dere are some folk who shy away from eating d' 'Maiden's Hood'!  Ah, they dunno what dey're missin'!  Shear delight on yer tongue and dey do yer no 'arm at all at all," he said, as he popped the cap into his mouth and tossed the stalk away, "Mmmm."
He sprang up onto a nearby toadstool seat, in that sprightly way leprechauns do, then sat cross legged with his eyes closed.  He remained in that position for several minutes, until his head gradually slumped lower into his chest and he began to snore, very, very loudly.  So loudly in fact, that two sparrows flying overhead fell stone-dead to the ground at Wyl's feet.
"Well that explains the absence of wildlife!" Wyl shouted at the leprechaun.
But, he couldn't hear himself, so he didn't suppose that Krackle had heard him either.
However, the leprechaun sputtered awake with a start, "Wassat? I heard birdsong..."
"You heard the birdsong?" exclaimed Wyl, with as much incredulity as he could muster.
"Och, not again.  Dem poor birdies," said the leprechaun with a deeply pained expression.
The snoring had given Wyl a headache, so he said impatiently, "Is that all you have to tell me, that I should head west and find a woman?"
"Ah, no, no, no," said the leprechaun, grinning again, "I wouldn't be much of a seer den, now would I?"
"Well then?"
"I has to tell yer d' vision of d' toadstool dream. So, you listen carefully now."
Wyl regained his politeness as the snore-induced headache began to fade, "Okay, I'm listening. Please do go on."
"You have to find de udder tongue."
Wyl was lost for words.
Krackle continued, "Dis tongue is powerful, but when d' tongues are paired, deir spells become recursive, each tongue curses d' udder wid a spell more powerful dan d' last, d' spell damage goes exponential.  As for what damage deir spiral of combined power would do... well, dat's more dan I can imagine, even in a toadstool dream."
"Where do I find it?" said Wyl, resignedly.
"De woman you seek, to d' west, she has it."
"Will she give it me, or sell it?"
"I doubt it; if she can speak, den she is still using it."
"I have to kill her?"
"She is a powerful enchantress and..."
"This just keeps on getting better," Wyl guffawed sarcastically.
"She was de wife of d' warlock."
"Oh, a doddle then," Wyl continued with mock bravado, "I just saunter up and say, 'Stick your tongue out please madam, I want to pair it with your deceased husband's.  And please don't worry, this won't hurt a bit!'"
"Dere, dere now, young mage; Eweline is d' wisest old hag I know, so have a liddle faith. From de dream, I know your destiny lies somewhere on d' Sea o' Dreams.  Dat's all I know, but you could seek help at d' Alizarin Monastery. Go west from d' crossroads, you can't miss it.  Be careful once you leave d' monastery, it's wild country beyond."
Wyl took a long deep breath, "I better buy provisions," he said with a sigh.
"I have just d' t'ing," said Krackle, as he dropped from the toadstool and went into the house.  He returned with a small sack of bread rolls, "Dis is my very special Shroom Bread, it'll increase yer stamina an' spirit for a short while, very 'andy just before a fight, an' a bargain at only five coppers!"
"Ok, I'll take it," said Wyl, as he counted out the coppers from his purse.
The leprechaun pocketed the coins, yawning as he handed over the sack, "Time for my nap."
"And time for me to go," said Wyl, as he quickly summoned his mount, anxious to leave before the snoring resumed.
The leprechaun shrugged, "I tell you what, I'll give you some leprechaun luck to take along wid yer."
With a flick of the wrist, he conjured a seven-leaf clover and handed it to Wyl, "Just use this when you need a wee bit o' luck to go a long way."
"Thanks, you are very kind.  Goodbye," said Wyl, as he shoved the leaf into his backpack and rode quickly on.


To his great relief, he escaped the clearing and made it back to the path, without suffering again the lethal snoring.  He headed west, but within the hour he was feeling tired himself and the light was beginning to fail.  He dismissed his mount and sat beneath a large oak tree.  He took a drink of spring water, wrapped his cloak around him and lay his head on his backpack.  With a snap of his fingers he cast Invisible Shield around himself and then lay still in the gathering darkness.  As his eyelids grew heavy, he pondered on what the journey ahead would bring, especially what the leprechaun had meant by 'wild country'.  Tiredness soon overcame him and he sank into sleep.  He dreamt of playing by the river at home, during his boyhood; a hot summer sun sparkling on the bright water; he and his brothers splashing about.  He recalled the day they caught some Deviate Fish and Mum made Savoury Deviate Delight.  When they ate it, they were all transformed into pirates for a day!  It was such great fun.  Mum joined in too, and what a fulsome wench she made, with her tight stripy tee, blue breeches and red bandanna.  She loved swinging about with a dagger between her teeth, but, she didn't care so much for the wooden leg!  Wyl still teased her over that from time to time.  Eventually, the warm summer dreams gave way to deep, restful sleep, until again came the morning and that familiar heartache.
