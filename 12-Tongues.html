[Suzze rez’s as Mage not Warlock?  Or maybe is Warlock but with mage memories - but how can he be on the side of the Alliance?  Make it clear that the war on Zarqoma is both factions!]




Into Citadel graveyard


fight into tower


sulphurous stench; Krendal & Psiglo shout “Grend!”


Port 3 draenei but get killed by rush of demons who overrun corpse
cast Cradle to Grave
The essence of his being imploded upon itself, until his soul was a mere singularity.






port self


3 draenei in last ditch stand against Arcanist and demon cohort
Krendal roared, soaked from head to toe in dripping blood and gore
Demon battle


Lord of the Nether
A 50ft beast of scale, smoke and flame with gnashing teeth and terrible claws, flaming eyes
Claw screeching on forcefield. Ears bleeding. Forcefield countdown. Fires of rage in demon's eyes;
Demon petrifies enemies.
Agony & despair


Use Tongue of the Undying Warlock & Enchantress
Uttered a sibbilant duet incantation that was unspeakable by any mortal tongue.






The heart from the land of fire that tempers and frost that burns


Back to whence it came

Emanations from Psiglo's totems:
Manna of the Gods:
Wisdom of the Ancestors; heard the encouraging whispers of generations of his forbears -  improved his dexterity, accuracy and spell power
Comforts of the Womb; some protection from incoming damage and gentle cell regrowth
Gifts of the Phallus; made him feel testosterone fueled, if somewhat sticky.


Psychic Charge builds and enables ever more powerful spells to be cast;






Drifted silently down like golden snow.  He held out his hands and one settled gently onto his palm.  It looked beautiful, like a tiny delicate crystal dandelion seed.
The Arcanist spoke slowly and ominously, “Weep for them mage, these seeds of the souls of children as yet unborn, your future lives that shall never be.”
As Wyl watched, the seed melted to nothing.
“He's killing our future.”


Arcanist casts Fear – Wyl runs around as his life dwindles – but the curse ends – he reaches for the tongues – Arcanist casts Cradle to Grave


An instinctual, ancestral terror awoke within him; he knew it and feared it and hated it; as did every sentient being in existence.  A pan-dimensional evil so malefic, that a single universe could not contain it. The Devourer of Souls, The Death of Deaths, The Final Assimilation.  Its amorphous flesh boiled, hissed and erupted continuously, in an obscene chaos of tongues: slimy tongues, barbed tongues, sharp tongues, stinging tongues, forked tongues, writhing tongues, ululating tongues, lashing tongues, glutinous tongues, foetid tongues, poison tongues.  It tore, crushed, digested and absorbed, seeming impervious to the constant barrage of blows, curses and spells, that the Arcanist and his demon cohort rained down upon it.  It distorted the space within its radius of malevolence, as if it were consuming the very fabric of the cosmos. The more they hurled at it, the more it grew and festered; the faster the demons poured in through the nether-portal, the faster they were devoured.  The smoke-filled air was thick with the flashes and radiances of every school of destructive magic, from elemental to arcane, from nature to shadow, but nothing made any impression on the Great Old One, which just slithered inexorably toward the nether-portal, until it engulfed the very portal itself and consumed it, as if it were merely physical.










Boomer stooped to pick up a spluttering torch from the tunnel floor, “Careless of the lads to drop this here... ugh!” he said in alarm, as he dropped the torch, “It's covered in slime.  Look lively, something's afoot!” he continued as he cocked his rifle.
Krendal stepped forward and picked up the torch, “Cover me.”
“Aye mate,” said Boomer.
, then followed a few steps behind Krendal as the warrior edged into the gloom ahead.


Psiglo dropped a clutch of totems and Wyl immediately felt his manna and spell power boosted.
Krendal got about twenty yards further then stopped, “There's a shaft,” he shouted back, “It goes up and down.”
Wyl, Psiglo and Boomer joined Grend and Krendal.
Wyl looked up, following the gaze of the dwarf.  About thirty feet above them a heavy wrought iron gate capped the top of the shaft; beyond it, a dark-red portal flickered balefully.
“Aye, that's it,” Boomer said, “That's the portal, beneath the central tower of the citadel.”
“So this shaft must be the means by which the Arcanist channels the fel-energy to the portal,” said Krendal.
“I reckon,” said Boomer.
“Where is the advance party?” asked Grend.
They all looked down into the pit of unfathomable darkness.
“Och, no, not ma laddies,” groaned Boomer.
Wyl closed his eyes and strained his magi senses to explore the darkness.
“There is something big down there,” he whispered, “And whatever it is, the Arcanist clearly felt the need to keep it trapped in here.”
Boomer kept on mumbling, “Ma boys... ma boys... ma boys.”
The flickering torch flame sparkled on the tears in the dwarf's eyes.
“Your sons?” asked Wyl.
“Aye,” said the dwarf, sadly.
Boomer unhitched his backpack and started emptying the contents on the ground.  He stood up when he found the heavy rope and tools he was looking for.
“You fellows go up and complete the mission.  I'm going down.”
“But...” began Krendal.
“You won't change ma mind so don't try,” said the dwarf firmly.
As Boomer began to hammer a metal stake into the cave floor, Psiglo stepped forward and took the hammer.
“Here, let me,” he said.
After four mighty blows from the big Draenei, the stake was firmly embedded.
Boomer tied the rope and tossed the loose end into the pit.
Then he turned to Wyl, “You better hurry, the sappers will have breached the walls by now and the Arcanist will soon be calling up his demon reinforcements through the portal.  You can't let that happen.”
Boomer wrapped more rope around his shoulders and neck, shoved the hammer and more stakes into his belt and took hold of the dangling rope.
“Best o' luck to you all,” he said as he stepped back and lowered himself into the darkness, while the others watched.
