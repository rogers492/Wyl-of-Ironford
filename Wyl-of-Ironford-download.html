The Witch's Errand


LEPRECHAUN


Again came the morning, with that painful reminder that her love was forever lost.  Though he had to force himself to rise, he was ready to leave within the hour.


Completing his final baggage checks, Wyl stared into the glass jar in his hand, at the lump of rotten flesh wriggling grotesquely within the viscous green fluid, wondering if the legends about it could be true.
He mumbled a prayer to his arcane gods, "I beg ye, preserve the potency of the potion, until I am rid of it."
And, he hoped, rid of it in return for a handsome reward. He recalled that drunken evening at the Happy Fool Inn, almost two moons past, and the hushed words of the old antiquarian, “Yes, that's it, The Tongue of the Undying Warlock.  Must be worth an ox-cart of gold!”


Wyl stuffed the jar into his pack and mounted up.  He enjoyed riding, it made him feel tall, which he was for a gnome, nearly three feet without boots. As he cantered down to the rough road he began to regret the innkeeper's generosity at breakfast.  He stood up in the stirrups and let rip a thunderous fart.
"Ha ha! Warlock, how does that taste upon your wicked tongue?  I've cleared a copper mine or two in my time!" he laughed, as he spurred his mount on.






It was a fine day and a pleasant ride along the forest road, even though the sun was rarely glimpsed between the tall trees.  Wyl rode steadily for several hours, chewing on a crust as he got peckish, or taking a swig of sparkling spring water to slake his thirst.  It was late afternoon before he reached the crossroads to which the innkeeper had directed him.  He took the path to the north, as advised, but it soon became grassy and indistinct as the wood thickened.


As his eyes grew accustomed to the deepening gloom, Wyl noticed wolves prowling around in the shadows.  He rode on more carefully, successfully avoiding the attention of the wolves, until he was stopped short by the sight ahead of a particularly vicious looking alpha male.  He recognised it from a poster at the inn, “Deepfang - wanted dead, in return for a handsome reward.”  The two huge fangs required as proof of the kill were wickedly prominent.  It looked a formidable beast, but it was isolated from the rest of the pack and Wyl was seriously thinking of bagging the kill and claiming the reward on his return journey.  But then he noticed he and the wolf were not alone.  Through the trees beyond Deepfang, stood a troll huntress, her bow aimed directly at Wyl, her trained raptor slavering by her side.
“Horde!” hissed Wyl, under his breath.
Wyl started calculating for the fight; she was outside his spell range so he would have to rush forward, but she was sure to get at least one poisoned or enchanted arrow into him before he could cast.  Even if he immobilised both her and the raptor, she would fire more arrows.  And she may have laid traps, perhaps intended for Deepfang, but they would spring their deadly attacks on Wyl if he triggered them.  No, best just to go for highest rate of damage and hope he outgunned her, he would deal with the pet if he bested the huntress.  But the the huntress suddenly swung her bow in the direction of Deepfang and let the arrow fly.  It was an explosive impact shot that echoed loudly throughout the forest, startling birds and other wildlife.  Deepfang just seemed to shrug it off, growled with rage and turned towards the huntress, but a concussive shot hit him next to leave him momentarily dazed and confused.  By now, the raptor was upon the wolf, leaping up at the canine and slashing with it's terrible claws.  Deepfang awoke from the daze and fought back with a terrible gnashing bite that crushed the raptor's neck, before tossing the dinosaur aside like a bloody rag.  But then a perfectly-aimed, anatomy-dissecting arrow hit home and Deepfang sensed the huntress was his nemesis.  Enraged, he dashed towards her with a frothy, berserk growl and was almost upon the crouching troll when her trap sprung and the nest of irate vipers hissed and struck.  The eyes of the once terrifying pack-leader rolled in consternation even as he snapped back at the snapping snakes, but he grew visibly weaker with each passing second as the venom took effect, until he gave up and cried a final forlorn howl.  Then he whimpered, twitched and staggered, to fall deathly silent at the feet of the huntress.  The snakes hissed away into the undergrowth as the troll observed some brief rite of thanksgiving.   Wyl bowed to the troll and she bowed back.  Still tensed for action, Wyl rode past her as she took out her skinning knife.  At fifty yards range he glanced back; she was busy removing the huge fangs and the hide of the defeated wolf.  Wyl relaxed and continued on his way.


With the excitement over, Wyl noticed that this part of the forest was very quiet. The wonderful forest birdsong, which had been a constant melody over the rhythm of his mount's hooves, was here totally absent. All he could hear was an occasional creak and an eerie wind moving through the branches.


Not entirely sure he was on still on the right path, Wyl dismounted and continued at a slow walk, until a short while later, he arrived at a leafy glade covered in all manner of exotic fungi.  At the centre of the glade stood a particularly large and gnarled old toadstool, that had windows and a wooden door, just as the innkeeper had described it.  Wyl stood at the door and knocked.  After only a moment, the door swung open and a leprechaun grinned up at him.
"Welcome!  Welcome!" he said, stepping out of the toadstool house.
"Thank you and hello," said Wyl.
The leprechaun inhaled a deep breath, "Ah, it's a bootiful day, to be sure."
"Indeed it is," said Wyl.
"Me name is Krackle! I used to be famous t'roughout d' land; me an' my two brudders; maybe you remember us?"
Wyl thought for a moment, but all he could think of right then was breakfast, "Er, sorry..."
"No?  Well, never you mind.  An' who would you be den?"
"I am Wyl of Ironford.”
“Ironforge, eh?  Tis a wonderful place Ironforge, great beer!”
“No, not Ironforge,” Wyl said in a slightly exasperated voice, “Iron… ford.  Don’t worry, it’s a common mistake.  I'm here on an errand for Eweline."
"Well 'oil' be blessed!" said the leprechaun, "An' 'ow is de old witch?"
"She was in good health when I left her, almost seven moons past."
"Ah, good, good. An' what would she be wantin' wi' d' likes o' me good self?"
Wyl took the jar from his backpack and showed the Tongue of the Undying Warlock to the leprechaun, "She asked me to deliver this."
"Begorrah!  Dat is a rare an' powerful artefact, to be sure. But what would I be doin' wi' such a t'ing?"
Wyl was momentarily nonplussed, "Well, er, Eweline said you would know someone who needed it.  So, I was hoping you would give me a good price for it."
"Ah, I see," said the leprechaun, smiling, "Dis is a very special item. I wouldn't vend it if I wuz you. But I can 'elp you find out who needs it."
"Oh, thanks," said Wyl, a little disappointed.
Krackle rummaged in his waist pouch, "Let me see. Ah, 'ere we go. Put d' jar down right dere on d' grass."
Wyl put the jar by Krackle's feet and stepped back.
"A liddle of de right faerie dust," said Krackle, grinning as he spun around while sprinkling something on the grass around the jar.
Instantly, a ring of small flesh-pink toadstools grew up around the jar, "Dere yer go!" said the grinning leprechaun, "Ah, see, we've grown d' 'Maiden's Hood'.  So, wouldn't yer know it, dere's a lady in yer future.  Now den, dat's d' largest," he announced, pointing at a toadstool which was several inches taller than the rest, "So, you will be heading, west!"
Krackle then stooped slightly and plucked the largest toadstool. He sniffed it appreciatively, "Yer know, dere are some folk who shy away from eating d' 'Maiden's Hood'!  Ah, they dunno what dey're missin'!  Shear delight on yer tongue and dey do yer no 'arm at all at all," he said, as he popped the cap into his mouth and tossed the stalk away, "Mmmm."
He sprang up onto a nearby toadstool seat, in that sprightly way leprechauns do, then sat cross legged with his eyes closed.  He remained in that position for several minutes, until his head gradually slumped lower into his chest and he began to snore, very, very loudly.  So loudly in fact, that two sparrows flying overhead fell stone-dead to the ground at Wyl's feet.
"Well that explains the absence of wildlife!" Wyl shouted at the leprechaun.
But, he couldn't hear himself, so he didn't suppose that Krackle had heard him either.
However, the leprechaun sputtered awake with a start, "Wassat? I heard birdsong..."
"You heard the birdsong?" exclaimed Wyl, with as much incredulity as he could muster.
"Och, not again.  Dem poor birdies," said the leprechaun with a deeply pained expression.
The snoring had given Wyl a headache, so he said impatiently, "Is that all you have to tell me, that I should head west and find a woman?"
"Ah, no, no, no," said the leprechaun, grinning again, "I wouldn't be much of a seer den, now would I?"
"Well then?"
"I has to tell yer d' vision of d' toadstool dream. So, you listen carefully now."
Wyl regained his politeness as the snore-induced headache began to fade, "Okay, I'm listening. Please do go on."
"You have to find de udder tongue."
Wyl was lost for words.
Krackle continued, "Dis tongue is powerful, but when d' tongues are paired, deir spells become recursive, each tongue curses d' udder wid a spell more powerful dan d' last, d' spell damage goes exponential.  As for what damage deir spiral of combined power would do... well, dat's more dan I can imagine, even in a toadstool dream."
"Where do I find it?" said Wyl, resignedly.
"De woman you seek, to d' west, she has it."
"Will she give it me, or sell it?"
"I doubt it; if she can speak, den she is still using it."
"I have to kill her?"
"She is a powerful enchantress and..."
"This just keeps on getting better," Wyl guffawed sarcastically.
"She was de wife of d' warlock."
"Oh, a doddle then," Wyl continued with mock bravado, "I just saunter up and say, 'Stick your tongue out please madam, I want to pair it with your deceased husband's.  And please don't worry, this won't hurt a bit!'"
"Dere, dere now, young mage; Eweline is d' wisest old hag I know, so have a liddle faith. From de dream, I know your destiny lies somewhere on d' Sea o' Dreams.  Dat's all I know, but you could seek help at d' Alizarin Monastery. Go west from d' crossroads, you can't miss it.  Be careful once you leave d' monastery, it's wild country beyond."
Wyl took a long deep breath, "I better buy provisions," he said with a sigh.
"I have just d' t'ing," said Krackle, as he dropped from the toadstool and went into the house.  He returned with a small sack of bread rolls, "Dis is my very special Shroom Bread, it'll increase yer stamina an' spirit for a short while, very 'andy just before a fight, an' a bargain at only five coppers!"
"Ok, I'll take it," said Wyl, as he counted out the coppers from his purse.
The leprechaun pocketed the coins, yawning as he handed over the sack, "Time for my nap."
"And time for me to go," said Wyl, as he quickly summoned his mount, anxious to leave before the snoring resumed.
The leprechaun shrugged, "I tell you what, I'll give you some leprechaun luck to take along wid yer."
With a flick of the wrist, he conjured a seven-leaf clover and handed it to Wyl, "Just use this when you need a wee bit o' luck to go a long way."
"Thanks, you are very kind.  Goodbye," said Wyl, as he shoved the leaf into his backpack and rode quickly on.


To his great relief, he escaped the clearing and made it back to the path, without suffering again the lethal snoring.  He headed west, but within the hour he was feeling tired himself and the light was beginning to fail.  He dismissed his mount and sat beneath a large oak tree.  He took a drink of spring water, wrapped his cloak around him and lay his head on his backpack.  With a snap of his fingers he cast Invisible Shield around himself and then lay still in the gathering darkness.  As his eyelids grew heavy, he pondered on what the journey ahead would bring, especially what the leprechaun had meant by 'wild country'.  Tiredness soon overcame him and he sank into sleep.  He dreamt of playing by the river at home, during his boyhood; a hot summer sun sparkling on the bright water; he and his brothers splashing about.  He recalled the day they caught some Deviate Fish and Mum made Savoury Deviate Delight.  When they ate it, they were all transformed into pirates for a day!  It was such great fun.  Mum joined in too, and what a fulsome wench she made, with her tight stripy tee, blue breeches and red bandanna.  She loved swinging about with a dagger between her teeth, but, she didn't care so much for the wooden leg!  Wyl still teased her over that from time to time.  Eventually, the warm summer dreams gave way to deep, restful sleep, until again came the morning and that familiar heartache.


ABBOT




Just as the leprechaun had said, the Alizarin Monastery was easy to find.  The monks were slightly suspicious at first but Wyl was soon on a tour with the Abbot.
“All the way from mighty Ironforge indeed.  It is my very great pleasure to welcome such an illustrious guest.  Do please come this way.  We have many things that will interest a discerning gentleman such as yourself.  Within these walls, we have chosen a life of service to the holy light. We devote our labours to tasks that shine the pure light of holy reason, onto those deep shadows of ignorance that, in these dark days, blight the lives of so many.  Of course, we do have builders, farmers, smiths, tailors and other honest and essential professions amongst us.  However, our most gifted servants of the light dedicate themselves solely to, that most noble of vocations, inscription.  And here we are, the scriptorium!”
The Abbot pushed open the heavy door and they strode into a warm room filled with several desks. At each, a monk sat scribing intently on manuscript.  Wyl followed the Abbot as he strode to the centre of the room, where they halted before one of the desks.
“Brother Ambrose here, has spent fifteen years, working on just, this, single, letter - the Glyph, of Wasted Talents!” announced the Abbot with an unabashed swagger.
Brother Ambrose paused his writing, with the wet nib poised adroitly over the magnificent swirl of line and colour, making no effort to disguise his pride, as he beamed up at Wyl.
“Oh dear,” said the Abbot, “I think, Brother, that I may have inadvertently caused you to blot your work.”
With bated breath, they all leaned in to look closer; there was a blot of fresh black ink, slowly expanding across the middle of the glorious glyph. The face of Brother Ambrose turned to alabaster, as tears welled up in his eyes.
“Take heart Brother,” said the Abbot as he lay a gentle hand on the shoulder of Brother Ambrose, “Thy good intentions are thy salvation.”
The Abbot moved along a couple of desks, with Wyl in tow, pausing only slightly in deference to the quiet sobbing of Brother Ambrose, before he introduced the next scribe.
“This is Brother Gwillym, an authority on enchanting vellum.  If there is any weapon or armour enchantment you desire, then just name it and Brother Gwillym will prepare it before you leave.”
“Well actually, I think I have everything I need for now, thank you,” said Wyl.
“Well then, Brother Gwillym, perhaps a minor vellum, as a mere memento for our illustrious guest?”
“Oh thank you Abbot, I am greatly honoured,” said the scribe with a genuine smile, “I am very pleased with the one I have just inscribed,” he continued, blowing on the ink as he proffered the vellum to Wyl.
Wyl took the vellum and read the inscription: The Fiery Wrath of the Spirited Woman's Profanity; chance on hit; causes fifty fire damage; silences all enemies within twenty yards for twenty seconds.
“You are clearly very talented, Brother Gwillym,” Wyl said, smiling back, “I humbly accept your most gracious gift.”
The scribe and the Abbot looked satisfied as Wyl rolled the vellum and put it into his backpack.
The Abbot lead on, towards another heavy door, which he unlocked noisily with one of the many large iron keys that hung from his belt.
As he pushed the door open he announced, “And now, the repository of all our finest works, the Library of Illuminations!”
“But what of this impressive body of works?” asked Wyl, indicating a nearby scribe surrounded by piles of completed sheaves, who was scribbling furiously, adding to the pile even as they watched.
“Ah, yes, Brother Archer,” sighed the Abbot, with an obvious lack of enthusiasm,  “He is no doubt working on his next best seller.  We must draw comfort from the fact that the work of Brother Archer has kept our humble order going, through some difficult times.”
As the Abbot stepped through the doorway, Wyl took a sheaf from the top of the pile and read the title - 'How to Get Rich Quick in Azeroth.'  He quickly replaced the sheaf and followed the Abbot into the library.
The extensive bookshelves were arranged around the outside wall and well lit by light from a central cloister.
“Our library is the most extensive outside of Stormwind itself.  We have collected many original works and made a considerable contribution of our own.  I am sure the knowledge you seek can be found on these shelves.”
“Thank you Abbot.  I am very grateful for your assistance.  Please accept this small token of gratitude, that I hope will help you keep up your important good works,” Wyl said, as he offered a pouch of coins.
“Thank you, Wyl.  You can be sure your generous contribution will be put to good use in the service of the holy light.”
The Abbot pocketed the pouch then instructed Wyl as to the ordering of the shelves, “Maps and charts are along there, just beyond the grimoires and spell-books.  Our two most celebrated works, The Scroll of Ineffable Truths and the Book of Worthless Promises, are kept in a locked chest, and not made generally available.”
“Oh, why is that?”
“Because, the High Council of the Holy Orders determined that, widespread understanding of such matters, might be, well, bad for business.  However, an esteemed visitor such as yourself can be granted access on request.”
“Thank you Abbot, perhaps I will take advantage of your offer on my return journey.  For now, I will focus on the object of my quest.”
“As you wish. May the light guide you.  Oh! I almost forgot; please be aware that a few of the more esoteric volumes have enchantments or other protections that seek to dissuade the undeserving from acquiring their deeper knowledge.  Do take care,” said the Abbot as he bowed and withdrew.


Wyl made his way to the mapping section and scanned the many books on the shelves, some with fascinating titles: Atlas of the Nether Regions (Unexpurgated), The Geological Survey of the Gem Merchant's Widow, Tourist Guide to the Spirit World, Visit The Higher Dimensions on Ten Gold a Day and, The Empire of the Empty Heart.
Eventually, he came across The Complete Uncharted Seas – Second Edition.  He took the heavy scale-bound volume down and placed it on a nearby lectern.  He opened the book and checked the contents until he found the reference to The Sea of Dreams.  He opened the book at the page indicated; it was blank.
After a moment staring at the blank page, he went to close the book, but was startled when the book spoke, “Patience seafarer!  Your uncharted sea is being charted for you now,” said the book.
Wyl waited and watched the blank page.  Lines began to appear, as if being drawn by an invisible pen.  A chart soon took shape, of an inland sea with a small island at its centre; The Isle of Disenchantment.  Wyl studied the map, committing it to memory, then closed the book and carefully replaced it on the shelf.


Wyl let his gaze roam freely around the other shelves.  He loved books and saw many interesting titles.  He resisted the temptation to take down a book for a browse, until his finger ran across: Mysteries of the Multiverse, volume XV - Where Do The Odd Socks Go?  He recalled his mum looking furiously perplexed on washday and thought she might be pleased if he could solve this mystery for her.  He took down the book, but as he went to open it a six-foot book-wyrm sprang from the pages and wrapped its scaly coils tightly around him!  Wyl dropped the book in astonishment and managed to cast Blink before the book-wyrm could exhale its fiery breath, teleporting himself to safety a few yards further down the aisle.  The book-wyrm fell to the floor, then wriggled over to the book and shrank back between its pages.  Wyl regained his composure, then gingerly replaced the book, before he hurriedly left the library.


DRYAD


For three more days Wyl travelled: through a forest, then down into a rocky valley, then up into another area of woodland.  There were a few lesser bears and wolves around, but they were wary of a gnome of such obvious power, so they left him alone.


The forest seemed to become featureless and unchanging for a time, until Wyl chanced upon a sunlit glade.  At the centre of the glade was a crystal clear pool, fed by a gently burbling brook.  Across the pool, a beautiful nymph bathed in the waters.  Wholly unaware of his presence, she wrung the water from her long dark silky hair.  She danced in the shallow pool and splashed in play with the sparkling wisps that flit across the water, her laugh deeply sensual but brimming with joyful girlish giggles.


Suddenly, a squealing puck burst into the glade, immediately followed by three satyrs, all wielding heavy clubs.  The nymph and the puck were quickly surrounded by the nimble hoofed satyrs.  One of the satyrs began casting a net, but the nymph parried it and dodged past the caster. But the puck was caught by a hefty club and fell.  Though she could have escaped, the nymph hesitated at the cries of the puck and the lead satyr managed to net her on his second attempt.


Wyl dismounted and cast Frost-Bolt, slowing the lead satyr, giving the nymph time to break free of the net.  Then suddenly, even before the satyr's furious roars had faded, the glade was filled with a swarm of tomtes, hobs and pixies, who fell upon the satyrs with a barrage of magical and physical attacks.  The quiet peace of the glade was shattered with thuds, pops, bangs, whizzes and flashes.  As the satyrs scattered to flee the glade, the lead satyr ran towards Wyl.  Wyl quickly began casting Frost-Nova, but, as they closed on each other, their gazes locked and Wyl was surprised to see there a deep, humane sadness, rather than animal bestiality.  The satyr stared back at Wyl, club raised hesitantly.  Wyl cancelled his cast and the satyr gave a brief nod of recognition for his act of mercy, before bolting past Wyl into the forest.


“Greetings stranger,” came a voice from behind.
Wyl turned quickly to see a regal looking fairy hovering just above the ground, her large colourful butterfly wings fluttering gracefully.  Her pink sparkling hair was piled precariously upon her head and topped with a petite crown of petals; she held a large flower like a sceptre in one hand and a large seed pod like an orb in the other.
She spoke calmly, “Please accept our gratitude for your intervention.”
“Greetings and thank you,” said Wyl, relaxing.
“I am Clovis, Mab of the Corioli.”
“I am Wyl of Ironford.”
“Ah, Ironforge; a place of such great industry!  I have passed the time with pleasant company there, but I am always happy to return to the quiet blessings of our glade.”
“Indeed it is pleasant here.” said Wyl, ignoring the misunderstanding over his place of origin.
“Come, please let us offer you refreshment.”
“Thank you.”


The home of the Corioli was a small wooden village around a moonwell, at which a crowd had gathered.
Clovis gestured to the moonwell, “Thanks in part to you, our short ceremony can now take place.  I would be honoured if you would attend.”
“Thank you again,” said Wyl, “The honour is mine.”
Wyl stood and watched as Clovis stood before the fairy couple he had helped to rescue.  They were stood holding hands, faces bright with the sparkling moonbeams from the well, smiling despite their recent ordeal.  Clovis hushed the assembly as the couple knelt before her.  She held two old gnarled oaken staves, one in each hand, and chanted an ancient ritual into the sky.
“Spirits of the fae, hear our plea.  By your grace and favour, the time has come to disavow the beloved before us.  Grant us this, in your name.”
Then Clovis spoke to the couple, “Have you loved each other, from dawn until dusk of every Summer day?”
The couple answered together, “Yes, we have.”
“Have you loved each other, from dusk until dawn of every Summer night?”
“Yes, we have.”
Then I declare, by the power of the Staves of Coriolis, that your vows are now broken.  You are now free of your bondage to each other.  You may say your goodbyes.”
The crowd applauded as the couple hugged and kissed tenderly.


Clovis lay down the staves and embraced the couple in turn as they parted.  The puck addressed the crowd, “I depart now, for our settlement in Outland, where there is much to do in repairing the harm the wars there have wrought.”
The crowd applauded again.
The nymph then spoke, “I wish to embrace the Autumn.”
Clovis laughed heartily, “Then so you shall, Asthene,” she said, as she picked up one of the staves.
She turned to the crowd, “Eligible men, please step forward as you wish.  Asthene will be offering the warmth and wisdom of her Autumn.”
Two male fairies stepped forward, to more applause.
Then there was a shout from behind Wyl and shocked whispers from the crowd.  It was the bruised and bloodied satyr who had tried to abduct Asthene earlier.
“Hold!” cried Clovis, as elements of the crowd made to attack the satyr again.
Clovis turned to the satyr, “Speak, Rojaz!”
Rojaz the satyr spoke, “Asthene, I have loved you from afar, even as I have dishonoured you and myself.  But, I would honour you with all my heart, should you bless me with your Autumn.”
The crowd muttered loudly until Clovis shouted again, “Silence!”
Then Clovis conferred in a whisper with Asthene.
She turned back to the satyr, “To honour Asthene, you must first honour the Staves of Coriolis.  Even some of our own kind are rejected.  Are you prepared to take the Trial of the Staves, Rojaz?”
“I am!”
Clovis had to shout over the astonished mutterings of the crowd, “Then so be it!”
She took up the other staff and walked past the satyr, into the forest, followed by the crowd.
“Come.”
Wyl followed with the fairy crowd, until they all gathered around a fallen tree, where Clovis stood with a staff in each hand.
Clovis handed one of the staves to Rojaz, “Plant the staff here.  Renewal will signify your acceptance by Coriolis; otherwise you will rot and I shall strike you down to free your spirit, alas to wander the forests alone for evermore.”
Rojaz looked longingly at Asthene.  She looked back with heartfelt concern.  Rojaz smiled at that and mouthed a kiss.  Asthene smiled and blew one back.  Rojaz took a firm grip of the staff with both hands, holding it vertical, lifted it high, then drove it hard through the rotten wood of the fallen, fungus covered tree, into the mossy earth beneath.  Both hands still gripping the staff tightly, he waited, while everyone watched with bated breath.  The crowd gasped as a tiny green bud grew from just below the top of the staff, while roots grew out from the foot to sink into the dark earth.  Rojaz roared and released the staff as it took on the form of a young sapling.
“Renewal!” shouted Clovis, “His heart has been tested and accepted by Coriolis.”
The crowd cheered.  Rojaz turned and ran to Asthene.  They stood nose to nose for a second, before Clovis held out the other staff.  Asthene took a deep breath then took the staff.  The two other suitors stood before Asthene too, either side of Rojaz.
Clovis stood before her and performed the ancient ritual of the staves to call upon the favour of the fairy gods.
As Clovis finished, Asthene closed her eyes, planted the staff firmly and cried, “Coriolis, grant me please, an Autumn of warmth, wisdom and love.”
A bright yellow leaf drifted down to rest upon her shoulder.  Then another, then a red one, then an orange one.  Faster and faster the leaves spiraled down, until they had formed a fabulous Cloak of Autumn, hanging gracefully from her shoulders.  For a moment the leaves stopped falling; Asthene stood still with her eyes screwed tight-shut.


Then a single golden leaf drifted down, spiralling slowly around and weaving this way and that on the air, until it landed gently upon the head of Rojaz.  The crowd burst into thrilled applause and Asthene opened her eyes. She whooped to see the leaf on the head of Rojaz.  She took a step forward, removed her Cloak of Autumn and placed it around the shoulders of Rojaz.  Magically, the leafy cloak clasped around his neck.  Rojaz and Asthene embraced warmly, to cheers from the crowd. Then Rojaz and Asthene skipped joyfully around the clearing.


As the crowd dispersed, Clovis put a hand on the shoulder of Wyl and laughed, “Come young mage, let's get that refreshment I promised.  It's been a strange day, but then the whole world is changing too fast for an old fairy.”
“Ha! It's changing too fast for a young mage,” Wyl laughed with her.
But as Clovis and Wyl turned to go, Rojaz and Asthene trotted towards them and called out, “Mage, wait!”
Clovis and Wyl waited until Rojaz and Asthene stood before them.
“We have a gift for you, a thank you, for your mercy and the happiness it has brought us.”
Asthene unclasped the cloak from around Rojaz and held it out to Wyl.
Wyl hesitated.
“Please take it,” said Rojaz, “I have the Autumn of Asthene to keep me warm.”
Wyl looked askance at Clovis.
Clovis nodded assent, “Outwith the ritual, it is a magical cloak like any other, you can take it.”
“Then I am greatly honoured and I thank you,” said Wyl as he took the cloak.
He removed his own cloak and wrapped the Cloak of the Fairy Bride in Autumn around his shoulders.  Immediately he felt the rush of extra manna and increased spell power from the intellect and wisdom endowed by the cloak.
Wyl looked at Rojaz and Asthene, who were now lost in each other's eyes, and said, “I wish you both a long and happy Autumn.”
Rojaz and Asthene grinned widely and ran off into the forest, their laughter echoing around the glade.
Clovis looked after them, smiling wistfully, her eyes filled with affection, “It'll be a warm and wet one, no doubt.”


ROGUE


The next morning was damp and misty, with the clouds threatening rain.  Wyl ate the last of his Shroom Bread for breakfast, noting once again that it seemed to soothe his broken heart.  Then he waved goodbye to the dryads and rode out of the glade, over a ridge and carefully down the slippery wooded slope on the other side.  After an hour of fairly dense forest the trees thinned suddenly to a shoreline of dunes and coarse tufted grasses.  Wyl trotted out onto a small promontory overlooking a misty bay. He dismissed his mount and stood for several minutes to look out onto The Sea of Dreams.


Then, the Ring of Prescience, on the little finger of his left hand, began to tremble. He looked deep into the large blue gem atop the ring, at the swirling clouds within. The mists cleared to reveal the scene behind him; a pack of sentient rodents scurried about in the half-light beneath the trees, preparing their weapons and positioning for an attack.


Wyl spun around and cast his Frost Armour spell even as a flock of their arrows arched toward him. As they struck him, they froze and shattered into harmless powdered snow. Striding forward, he cast Arcane Missiles at the ringleader with one hand, as he pulled his wand from his belt with the other. The residual supernatural static flickered amongst them, making them dance and laugh like ticklish drunken revellers. With a flick of the wrist he flung Fireball at the group; it exploded among them setting their fur alight and causing screams and panic.   The attackers had had enough already and they turned to flee back into the forest.  It was barely a fight at all and Wyl was left wondering idly when he would ever get to exercise his wand.  He quickly cast a Frost Nova spell on one of the laggards, freezing him to the spot. The rest soon vanished, leaving their luckless comrade to his fate.


Wyl sauntered up to the captive, who shivered with the cold of the spell, but with fear too. Wyl unhitched his backpack and rifled through it until he pulled out the Eye of Remembering. He looked at the squishy eyeball within its nest of flesh and hair. As always, it looked as if it had been freshly torn from the head of its owner. It shed tears constantly, for it could never forget anything it had ever seen. Were they tears of sorrow or tears of joy? Who could know and stay sane with the knowledge? He quickly closed his hand over it, for he felt its insight stirring within his mind and as he knew only too well, it had a penchant for revealing memories you would rather forget. In any case, he had another subject for its examinations, one who was rapidly thawing.


He held the eye before the cowering rodent. The creature's feeble intelligence offered no resistance to the mental probing. A stream of memories and sensations tumbled into Wyl's mind, spinning backwards through time; sights, sounds, feelings; the full gamut of experience as the rodent had recently lived it; of the attack, the stalking, the packs early morning journey through the forest. Then, Wyl found what he sought; the captive was being berated by a particularly large and vicious looking ogre, beside a jetty with small boats - just what he needed to continue his journey. From the knowledge of the eye he knew where they were and how to get there. He put the eye back into his pack.  Though the freezing spell had worn-off, the rodent hadn't yet realized and stood in a daze.
Wyl raised his wand threateningly and shouted, "Begone!"


Wyl watched the rodent scurry into the forest as fast as his legs could carry him, while he mused on the deeper sadnesses the Eye had revealed within the mind of the rodent: Why am I always slower than the rest?  Why is everyone cleverer than me?  Why did mum never want to hug me?  Wyl conjured his mount and saddled-up.  Then he trotted along the southern shore into the thickening mists, wondering - why is it always 'why'?


Within the hour, Wyl arrived at the small fishing village on the bay. It was surrounded by a simple wooden palisade and had but one watchtower. Wyl knew it well, because the rodent whose memories he had stolen had grown up there. Even the smell of rotting fish wafting across seemed strangely comforting. The village was nothing more than a loose cluster of wooden huts around a rickety dock. The rodent villagers were going about their daily business. It would be difficult to just steal a boat without being seen, so a plan was called for.


He searched his backpack, looking for something to distract or quiesce the entire village. He had various dream philtres and sleeping potions, but it would be nigh impossible to drug everyone without being discovered.
He mumbled to himself as he rummaged, "Mmm, The Key to the Chastity Belt of the Thousand Year Virgin, never going to finish that quest," and tossed the key into the mud.
"Century Slumber Dust. Seems a little harsh to put them all to sleep for a hundred years just to borrow a boat."
"Burnt Midnight Oil. Ah, now that could do the trick," he whispered, swishing the dark fluid in the small, stoppered vial.


He looked up into the grey misty sky. The sun wasn't visible through the thick scudding clouds, but Wyl reckoned it must be a couple of hours to sunset. He found himself a dry spot and sat cross-legged amongst some tall, thick grasses.
As he wondered how he would subdue the village, his mind wandered, to that place it often did when his mind was unfocused, to the deep, dark eyes of the girl who lay within his heart; to her warm embrace; to their final kiss; to their last goodbye and that wonderful smile he hadn't realised he was seeing for the very last time.  He fell into a doze and dreamt of walking with her hand in hand, through a pleasant land of green and gentle hills.


He awoke with a shiver as a rivulet of cold rain trickled down his back. As his eyes focussed, the face of another formed before him; dark smouldering eyes looked out from between a shock of black hair and a red bandanna that masked the nose and mouth.  Wyl quickly took a firm grip on his staff, Dawning Wood, and tensed for action... but the stranger made no move.
After a few moments, Wyl spoke, "Good evening, rogue."
The stranger spoke quietly but deeply, with a thick gutter accent that seemed slightly affected, "Good evening, mage.  Careless of you to fall asleep."
"I sleep to dream."
"Then she must be a rare delight indeed. You are lucky to carry such a glow within your heart. Many yearn for such a dream, but merely sleep alone.  But, to business; I have a certain task to perform tonight in yonder village and I just wanted to make certain you and I are not going to get in each other's way."
"I also have a task in the village."
"Well, we could duel for the privilege, but that might attract unwanted attention."
"Most definitely."
"What is it you want in the village?"
"I want to steal a boat."
"Well, if that is all you want, we should have no quarrel. But, the village isn't as defenceless as it would first appear. It is the base for the local bandits."
"Yes, I know. They tried to ambush me earlier today."
"I see.  Then clearly you know how to handle yourself in a fight. Perhaps we can work together. I intend to collect the bounty on the head of their leader, Janmuri the Ogre. Of course, I also expect to help myself to their booty, but I could be persuaded to share."
"I agree collaboration would make the venture less risky for us both; I really have no need of anything but the boat."
The rogue shrugged, "As you wish. My plan was to quietly dispose of the sentries and then sneak into Janmuri's hut, assassinate him and his henchmen, loot the place and then sneak away. Unfortunately, when I scouted the place earlier I noticed he has a hellboar pet, which will smell me coming a mile off and wake the whole village."
"Mmmm, well my plan was to cast a nightmare curse diversion and steal a boat during the pandemonium. I was wondering how to get close to the centre of the village to cast the curse on a suitable subject or two. But, now you're here, I have an idea."
Despite the mask, Wyl could tell the rogue smiled knowingly.
"Yes," Wyl smiled back, "I will give you the agent of the curse. You can sneak in and curse the hellboar with it. It will sleep deeply, but all of it's worst nightmares will be projected into the real world for a few minutes. Only the gods can guess what phantasms of the fiery pit that creature will unleash upon the poor villagers!"
They both chuckled mischievously.
The rogue stood up, shaking off the raindrops, "The village has been quiet for a while, so we may as well get this over with. Then I can can get some sleep too."
The rain stopped and the clouds broke to reveal a gibbous moon that painted the ramshackle dwellings with a wan light.
“No matter,” whispered the rogue, looking skyward, “I’ll use stealth.”

Wyl collected his things and they crept down to a spot by the palisade and hid from the watchtower beneath a thick pall of smoke still rising slowly from the smoking-shed. As Wyl followed the rogue, he observed a smooth graceful movement and some fine feminine curves through the dark leather cuirass.
"You're a girl!"
The rogue spun around quickly and put her hand on the hilt of the brutal looking dagger at her waist.
"And what of it?!" she said in a stage whisper.
"Oh, nothing. But you were pretending to be a man."
"In my line of work, one uses many disguises."
"I suppose."
"Let's get on."
Wyl handed the vial to the rogue.
"Pour the oil onto some tasty morsel and lob it at the hellboar. There is enough for about ten minutes of nightmare. Ignore the nightmare phantoms, they will appear terrifying, but are harmless wisps. I will come in when I hear the screams."
The rogue slipped the vial into her waistband and nodded, "Thank you."
"By the way, I am Wyl. Who are you?"
"I?" her fading whisper was suddenly silkily feminine as she melted into the shadows.
"I?  I am the footfalls beneath your feet; I am the shade in the moon shadow; I am the kiss of the quick blade; I am the name on your final breath..."
Wyl stood very still and waited a few moments in silence, unsure at first that she had gone and strangely entranced by her final, somewhat theatrical whisperings. But then his rumbling stomach and the smell of kippers smoking reminded him how long it had been since breakfast.  If there was gold to be had, the rogue could keep it, he determined to loot himself some supper. He took his wand from his belt and listened intently.


Within moments, Wyl heard an agitated high pitched squeaking, which he took to be the screams of frightened rodents.  He used his Plume of the Fan-Dancer trinket, to levitate over the palisade and set-down just the other side, sniggering as he recalled the quest he had completed to obtain that particular trinket.  There was no sign of the rogue, but terrified rodents were scurrying in all directions,  their eyes bulging with fear.  Wyl ran past the smoking-shed, through the commotion and into the centre of the village, where he came to a sudden halt.  He could see the nightmare conjured by the hellboar; it was a thirty foot high hellboar sow.
Suddenly the rogue appeared, "I don't think that is the hellboar's nightmare; more like a wish come true, if the size of the mammaries are anything to go by!"
"Well, it seems to be working."
"But not quite as advertised; I just saw three rodents crushed to death beneath those mighty breasts.  That is no mere phantasm!"
"And it's headed this way!" cried Wyl in alarm.
"Run!  No! This way!  To the ogre!" commanded the rogue.
They skirted around the nearby huts until they were behind the huge sow.  Sure enough, the sow careened through a hut ahead of it and smashed it flat.  The horrible squeals from within the collapsing hut didn't last long.
"Where did you get that oil?  Booty Bay?"
"Not sure.  Darkmoon Faire, I think."
"Aha!  That'll teach you."
Then, bang!  Something heavy hit Wyl very hard on the back of the head and he was stunned.  As he spun around in a daze, he saw Janmuri the Ogre raising his wooden club to attack the rogue.  The rogue dodged the clumsy swipe and struck the ogre in the ribs with a swift stab of her savage looking dagger.  The ogre staggered and roared, but quickly raised his club again.  Wyl tried to cast a Frost Nova spell but was still incapacitated by the stun.  Two more ogres appeared, henchmen of Janmuri.  They crowded around the rogue and all three rained down blows while she did her best to duck and dive.  But a couple of glancing blows landed.  Even so, Wyl saw her dip her blade in poison as she rolled away from another vicious swing.  She lunged at one of the henchmen and stuck the poison blade in his fat belly even as the club of Janmuri whooshed just over her head.  Then, the other henchman caught her with a heavy blow and she was knocked backwards.  Janmuri turned to Wyl and lifted his club to strike, but Wyl shook himself out of his dazed state and cast Blink, reappearing twenty yards behind Janmuri, who looked dumbly around for the vanished mage.  Wyl cast Frost Nova and the feet of Janmuri were fixed within blocks of ice.  Janmuri had made the mistake of turning his back on the rogue; she dodged a swing by one of the henchmen to step up behind Janmuri and deliver a powerful backstab with her poison blade.  Janmuri sagged beneath the blow.  By now the poisoned henchman was turning green and clutching his throat.  Wyl fired Arcane Missiles at the other henchman just as he took aim at the rogue, and knocked him off his stride.  The rogue twisted around and stabbed the lethal blade into his belly.  Wyl launched a fireball at each of the ogres in turn.  The first poisoned henchman dropped to the ground with a loud thud.  The rogue now had a garotte around the throat of Janmuri and administered the kill as Wyl finished the other henchman with a blistering fireball.  By the time the fireballs stopped crackling, the three ogres lay still on the scorched earth.


Wyl looked around for the sow.  He could see it rampaging across the other side of the village, most of which was now splintered wood.
The rogue quickly looted the three ogre corpses, "Here, Janmuri has something I don't need."
Wyl stooped to collect the loot the rogue had left him; a small bottle of bright blue liquid, which had a single golden glyph embossed upon it.
"Come, the dock is this way," said the rogue.
They both ran along the rickety dock to the nearest sailing dinghy.  They clambered in and the rogue pushed them away from the dock, then took up the oars.  Wyl looked back to the shattered village.  The rodents were still in a panic, though it looked as if the hellboar sow had returned to the land of hellboar dreams.  Wyl felt pity for the rodents.
"We did them a favour," said the rogue, "They can rebuild their village and there will be no ogres to boss them around."
"I guess so." said Wyl, somewhat dismayed at the destruction and not entirely convinced that there weren't plenty of other ogres to take their place.
As they rowed further out onto the sea, Wyl hoisted the sail and took the tiller and mainsheet as the rogue stowed the oars.  The craft was soon running smoothly out of the bay on a steady beam reach, making for an easy sail.
“Head around the headland and then we’ll beach until morning,” said the rogue.
Wyl did as the rogue suggested and they were soon hauling the dinghy into a small deserted inlet.


As the rogue investigated the small beach and the nearby cliffs, Wyl looked again at the bottle he had looted from Janmuri.  The glyph looked familiar.  Then he recalled the crystal in his backpack.  He rummaged around until he found it; it looked lacklustre and neglected, but sure enough it bore the inverse imprint of the same embossed glyph.  Wyl felt guilty as he looked at it.  He put the bottle together with the crystal so the glyph images aligned and slotted together.  A puff of purple smoke rose from the crystal and formed a vision before him.


He saw an ancient white-haired alchemist with a long white beard, working busily over a hissing, burbling tangle of glass and copper apparatus.
The alchemist looked up, "Welcome stranger... ah, Wyl, is that you?”
Wyl said sheepishly, “Yes, it is I.”
“So, you still have the Soul-link?”
“Yes.”
“It's been a long time, my friend.”
“Yes it has. I'm sorry.”
After a brief moment of awkward silence, the alchemist smiled.
“So, you are wondering upon the nature of my work? It is the Elixir of Eternal Boyhood you possess. One of my finest potions, perfected over many years. Think carefully, before you use it. Surely, it will keep you young in mind and in body, until the end of thy natural term, such is its purpose. It will strip you of the weighty obligations of manhood. All feelings of responsibility will vanish, along with all the pain of failing to meet the expectations of others. Truly, thy life will be carefree for a time, filled full with play and petty dreams.  But be warned, you will lose your manly wisdom and every remembrance from which it has been forged.  You will forget all of thy deepest sorrows and all of thy most precious memories.  You will have no recollection of the warm glint in the eyes of thy one true love; who knew you to be a real man.  All thine acts of bravery, be they writ large or small upon the world, shall be unwoven from the fabric of time.  You will remain haunted by the childish fears you can never outgrow.  And when the end of your days arrives, there will be no sparkling diamonds shining proudly, from amidst the bitter ashes of thy many disasters.  You will count your life cheap, for what is the worth of a life filled with dreams you never had the courage to live?   It is your choice; be a boy, or be a man."
"An odd thing for an old ogre to possess," said Wyl.
“Not really, even old ogres hanker after the adventures of their boyhood.”
“And old alchemists?”
“They do sometimes... and sometimes... they drink too many potions for their own good.”
“I'm sorry I didn't get in touch.”
“The river flows faster than any of us realize.”
“I need your help now, if you don't mind?”
“Of course not, my friend.  How may I help you?”
“I'm lost and don't know how to find my way;  the sky above me is dark.  I remember the stars always shone for you.”
“Ah, then allow me.”
The alchemist looked up and waved his arm as if presenting the heavens.  The clouds were swept away by his gesture, to reveal a bright panoply of twinkling stars.
“There,” said the alchemist, pointing, “Just follow that bright star near the horizon.”
“Thank you, old friend, I will come visit, I promise.”
“Nay, Wyl, my flask lies cold and empty, beyond the plane of life.  I exist now only as the fading fragments of your memories.  Live well, old friend.”
The vision faded before Wyl, as tears filled his eyes.


VORTEX


Again came the morning and the familiar heartache, but the Shroom Bread was gone and so was the rogue.
"Are you stealthed again? I wish you wouldn't do that!" Wyl cried out.
There was a reply, faint with distance, "You go on your way; I'll go mine."
Wyl was tired and upset, so he didn't bother to respond.
"At least the sun is shining," he mumbled to himself as he watched the reflections glitter on the sea.
He called inland, to the rogue, “Farewell then.  I must go on, across the sea.”
He soon had the dinghy relaunched and sailed steadily without event, for a few hours.  During the afternoon, storm clouds began to gather ahead.  As the wind picked up the sky grew heavy and very dark.


Wyl hove-to and let out the main-sheet to wait-out the storm.  He lay back in the rocking boat, feeling a little sleepy despite the pitching.  Then, he thought he heard a whisper, over the sound of wind and water.  Then again, a single word.  He strained to hear it clearly.  It was repeated but he still couldn't make it out.
"Rogue?  Is that you?"
The whispering became more frequent, but was still barely audible.  Wyl sat up slowly and looked about, yet there was nothing to see around the boat apart from the dark water.  Gradually though, as his eyes became accustomed to the gloom, he made out a shoal of hippocampi swimming around the dinghy.  It seemed very odd, but they were definitely circling the boat.  And the longer he watched them, the more convinced he became, that it was these little seahorses that were whispering!
Wyl was so intent on making out what they were saying, that he even held his breath.
He could just begin to make out a word, "… whirls ..."
He leant further out, to hear better the tiny voices, "… little whirls ..."
They were repeating the same rhythmic chant over and over, so very quietly.
"Big whirls ... little whirls ... lesser whirls ..."
"Yes!" Wyl shouted in triumph when he got it:
Big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity,
And little whirls have lesser whirls and so on to vorticity.


The susurration went on and on, as the tiny, sparkling school maintained an unbroken slowly spinning circle around the boat, without change in tempo or amplitude.  Then Wyl became aware that the boat was moving, somehow propelled by the circulating action of the shoal.  Or was it?  Wyl's sense of space and time had become confused.  He felt a little dizzy.  He tipped back his head to take a deep breath and was shocked to see stars whizzing around the sky like sparks from a catherine wheel!  Day had become night! The whole celestial arc was spinning rapidly, as if the boat was turning fast beneath it.
The seahorse whispering continued on and on; the stars were moving so fast now, that the blackness of the night sky was coloured-in with the brightness of the stellar streaks, until the whole of the heavenly dome was bright with starlight!  Wyl felt a lightness in the pit of his stomach, as if he was being propelled downward at some incredible speed.  The dizziness increased until he swooned into a fitful dream.


Boyhood; that is where the dream took him, standing at the door to the classroom of his Master of Magics, who sat at his desk talking sternly to a senior girl pupil.
He beckoned Wyl to enter, “Come in and take a seat for a moment Wyl,” said the Grand Wizard.
Wyl took a seat by the door in the otherwise empty classroom.
The Grand Wizard turned his attention back to the other pupil, "It can't be done with positive energy density everywhere.  The causality violations appear in a finite region of space-time without curvature singularities.  There will be a Cauchy horizon that is compactly generated and that contains one or more closed null geodesics which will be incomplete. If the causality violation developed from a non-compact initial surface, the averaged weak energy condition must be violated on the Cauchy horizon."
The girl seemed only momentarily rebuffed before she mustered a confident response,"That does not rule out the possibility of non-compactly generated Cauchy horizons or regions which contain exotic matter, not to mention quantum gravity!"
The Grand Wizard sighed, “Okay Pippa, I look forward to reading that paper once you have the theory fully developed.  In the meantime, would you please do me the courtesy of returning your homework on time, so I might read that instead.  That will be all, thank you."
Wisely, the girl quit while the honours appeared even and promptly left the classroom.


The Grand Wizard raised his eyes to the ceiling, then looked at Wyl and smiled, "Don't look so worried, young Wyl.  I asked you to stay behind because you show such exceptional promise.  In fact, I think you're ready for some extra lessons.  I want to introduce you to a new teacher; a teacher who will broaden and deepen your knowledge in ways that the normal curriculum here doesn't offer.  Of course, it would mean extra work.  Are you interested?"
"Er, yes.  Thank you, Grand Wizard."
"Good.  Now then, there is something else I must do first.  But please come with me, you may find this educational too."
The Grand Wizard stood and conjured a portal.
"Come," he said as he stepped through.  Wyl followed immediately.  They stepped out onto a large neat lawn surrounded by tall clipped hedges and adjacent to a rambling country mansion.  A few people lay on the grass here and there, soaking up the warm evening sunshine.  A night-elf in a white coat noticed their appearance and walked over to meet them.
"Good evening, Grand Wizard," she said as she dipped her head slightly in deference.
"Good evening, Doctor.  This is Wyl, one of my most accomplished students."
"Welcome, Wyl," said the doctor.
"Good evening," said Wyl.
"I am so glad you could attend today, Grand Wizard.  I am afraid the patient's condition is deteriorating as predicted."
"Oh dear.  May I see her?"
"Certainly.  This way please."
As they followed the doctor across the lawn, the Grand Wizard explained in hushed tones, "This, young mage, is a place neither you or I would wish to end up."
"It's a hospital?"
"Sort of.  This is The Institute of Magical Health.  These patients you see here are all suffering from a very serious condition.  At one time they were all mages, sorcerers, witches, warlocks... that is, people of pronounced magical ability.  But now, they have lost all sense of magic.  They no-longer believe in magic.  They have lost all touch with reality."
"They're all mad?"
"Utterly.  Sad isn't it?  Imagine yourself, entirely cut-off from your inner spirit, without your keen sense of wonder in the magical nature of the world."
Wyl shuddered at the thought. "Is there no cure?"
"The doctors here work tirelessly in search of one.  But, none has yet been discovered.  There are some promising avenues of research.  For example, a recent study has shown that certain love philtres stimulate a very weak and temporary belief in magic.  One theory, that is very much in vogue, is that true love, the real thing and not some apothecary's simulation, would indeed cure the afflicted.  However, the critics of the theory claim that one has to believe in magic to ever fall in love.  This topic will be hotly debated for some time yet, I fear."
"Here she is, Grand Wizard," said the doctor, as she pointed out a frumpy old woman sat on a wooden bench.  She was sitting still and relaxed with a distant, vacant stare.
"Thank you, doctor.  Wyl, allow me to introduce my wife, The Great Golden Sorceress of the Seven Golden Dawns."
"Oh, hello dear," said the twee little woman to Wyl.  "Take no notice of him," she winked, "he's a bit loopy!"
"My dear," said the Grand Wizard, "your shoelace is undone."
"Oh my, so it is." said the woman, as she stooped to tie it.
Wyl and the Grand Wizard watched her struggle to tie the lace for several minutes.  Then the Grand Wizard stooped and kissed her on the cheek, "Goodbye, my dear," he said sadly as he turned and motioned Wyl and the doctor to follow him.
"You see? Once upon a time she would have just snapped her fingers.  I hope this hasn't upset you, young mage.  Your coming of age is near, so it is as well you should see something of the wider world, warts and all."
The Grand Wizard conjured another portal and turned to the doctor, "Thank you, doctor.  Please make her as comfortable as you can.  Goodbye."
Then he turned to Wyl, "Come, I shall now introduce you to someone who is in full command of all her magical faculties.  Of that, there is no doubt."


Suddenly, the dreaming sleep ended, as, with an involuntary groan, Wyl leant over starboard and wretched only air and saliva, his eyes screwed tight with the pain of the convulsions.  As the spasms subsided, he raised his head and squinted through his tears.  He was astonished to find himself looking at dry sunlit sand, rather than dark water!  He sat up quickly and looked around.  He was still in the boat, but the boat lay in a sandy desert!  In fact, the weathered coral-encrusted rocks nearby indicated straight away that this was a dried up seabed!  Casting his gaze farther afield, Wyl was further amazed by what he saw.  The sands were littered with the crumbling abandoned hulks of boats and ships of all kinds, from small boats like his, to yachts to frigates to galleons.  It looked like a ship graveyard and it stretched for miles.  There was no sign of the multitude of sailors that must have piloted these vessels, to this world bereft of sea; not even a vacant skull or a rusty cutlass.  He felt a deep foreboding; this place, was a last resting place.


He stepped from the boat and began to walk towards a rocky outcrop that he hoped would provide a vantage point.  The air was hot, dry and dusty.  He conjured a pouch of fresh spring water and took a few swigs as he walked, relishing the buzz as the manna revitalised his wizardly powers.  As he approached the base of the outcrop, his feet crunched upon the bleached bones of fishes.  For a split second, Wyl envisaged the fish crowded together in the rock-pool in the shade of the promontory, gasping as the last vestige of a once mighty ocean dwindled away beneath an unforgiving sun.  He tried to think no more about it as he passed over them.  He scrambled up the side of the rocky outcrop, gaining easy purchase on the ancient corals, but reaching the flat top sweaty and out of breath.  He stood to look around.  The ancient seabed stretched unbroken in all directions except for where it met a ridge of sheer cliffs in one direction and, in the opposite direction, some way off, where there appeared to be an oasis.  He looked again at the cliffs, then back at the oasis, thinking every sailor before him must have chosen the oasis.  What sirens might he find there?  Perhaps this was the final destination of every sailor on the seas of fate?  Perhaps this was his final destination?  Perhaps this was the Isle of Disenchantment?  He scrambled back down from the rock, summoned his mount and set off toward the oasis.


EHCHANTRESS


Within a short time, he was close enough to discern a large walled house of Moorish design nestled among tall palms.  It shimmered in the desert heat, so much at times that Wyl wondered if it might be a mirage.  The fierce sun burned remorselessly.  The hot dust scratched his throat and clogged his lungs.  Though he trudged steadily onwards, the palm fringed oasis seemed to get no nearer.  He stopped several times to drink until his stock of spring water was depleted.  When he conjured more, he realised his manna was ebbing away,  or perhaps being sucked from him.  He felt so hot and so weary.  His mount was struggling to breathe as it ascended a sand dune, then it suddenly de-materialised and Wyl found himself dumped onto the hot sand.  His tongue felt dry and swollen as it swept slowly across his cracked lips.  His vision was blurred and he was confused.  Where was the oasis?  He scrambled to the top of the dune in a panic.  Ah, there it was.  He stumbled on, feeling as if the sun was burning a hole into his head.  He tripped and fell.  He found himself entangled in a pile of dry bones and pitted armour.  He stood wearily to look upon the fallen warrior and found there were the remains of three, around a long dead camp-fire.  Perhaps they had accepted their fate and just joined together in a final meal, before the desert dried their bones?  Wyl fell to his knees, vehemently wishing he could extinguish the sun!  Was this it?  Was this the end?  How ironic, that he should die here in this baking dessert!  He slumped into a sweaty heap, eyes closed, mouth parched.  He thought of home, a place of permanent snow and frost.  He thought then of the day he left.


He had known her for most of his life, yet they stood together in awkward silence, looking along the frozen dirt road to Kharanos and beyond.  The incessant Coldridge wind wailed its goodbyes, while the snow flurries swirled around them, as if urging them back together. He looked at her pretty white face, an icy jewel in a white frozen landscape.  Their frosted breaths danced and mingled until the wind tore them away.
"Please don't leave," she begged tearfully.
He found no words fit to say.  He felt his resolve begin to weaken, but he let his welling tears freeze over before they rose past his heart.  He set his jaw and reset his gaze along the road out of the valley.  He wondered to himself, why, in a land so cold, she offered no warmth, only her pain.
"Goodbye," he said, as he turned and walked away towards Kharanos, without ever daring to look back.


No! He would not die here in this dessert of the forsaken!  When his time came, he would lay down his bones where they belonged, beneath the permafrost.  He concentrated hard and cast Blink.  The oasis did appear a little closer.  He walked slowly towards it and it seemed to get no nearer.  He cast Blink again; yes, it was closer, but his manna was too low to get him there.  Then he remembered the Seven Leaf Clover.
He took it from his backpack, “Well Krackle, you did say it would make a little luck go a long way!”
He cast Blink once more.  It worked! He was standing beneath the shade of a palm, respite at last from the relentless sun.  A freshwater spring burbled at the centre of a small pool.  He waded in and scooped handfuls of the cool water into his mouth and let the refreshing water trickle over his face.  He sat in the pool, momentarily underwater, then sprang up feeling much revived.  He then sloshed out of the water up to the house.


Even close-up, it still shimmered.  He recognized it for what it was; a dream house; an enchanter's snare; a place of illusions, where the magics and physics of the real world no longer applied. If he were not very careful, he would remain captivated by some sweet delight within the dream house and never leave. His real body would wither and rot, while his soul became a figment of the dream for evermore. But he must enter, for somewhere within the dream house lay the object of his quest. He rummaged through his backpack and pulled out an alarm clock. He set the alarm to go off in one hour, dream-time, then popped it back into his backpack.
As he reached for the doors, they swung slowly inward of their own accord.  Wyl stepped cautiously into the cool hallway and stood still for a moment, as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom.  The only sounds were the distant ghostly echoes of children laughing, like innocents lost in limbo.
 The double doors at the far end of the hallway swung open to reveal a beautiful and elegant lady. Her lips were red and full, her eyes were brilliant blue. Her strawberry-blonde hair hung past her shoulders. Her gently heaving bosom drew attention to her hour-glass figure.
"Time is a thief," she said darkly, with a trace of sadness in her voice, "Inexorable, irreversible and stealthier than any rogue.  It takes from us all of the things we hold most dear.  Most unforgivably, it takes from us the people we love."
“How true.”
"You feel a deep sense of loss, in your heart.  A lost love?  What happened to her?"
"Last I heard, she was running the orphanage in Stormwind."
"Laudable."
"Mmmm, but what a price for such a bright mind and brave heart to pay."
"The children must need her care."
"Yes and she will set them off on their way in the wide world, while for her, the whole of Azeroth lies undiscovered."
“She made her choice.”
“Yes, she did.”
“And you made yours.”
“Yes.”
The lady smiled and her demeanour lightened, "Please do come,” she said, “we can talk in the garden."
She spun effortlessly around and the sunlight cascading through the ornate windows caressed her, as she swept majestically along. Wyl could do nought but follow.
"So, you have the tongue of my former husband," she said in a matter of fact tone, but with a cheeky sideways glance.
Wyl was startled by her foreknowledge, but kept his composure, "Indeed."
She giggled, "You know, he used to say that I had a wicked tongue!"
"Surely, you jest," Wyl laughed nervously.
A large wooden door swung open before them and they strolled out into a rose garden. Amongst the roses stood many life-size statues of people: mariners, warriors and others. They continued walking beneath the rose-arbour. The scents and colours in the dappled shade were enchanting.
"Jest? Not I sir," she said, smiling as she tilted her head seductively, "Perhaps you came for my tongue too, to make up the pair?"
"Er, well..."
She stopped and inhaled deeply, "Ahh, don't you think the roses smell wonderful."
"Er, yes..."
"I have created many new varieties. I get such joy from bringing a new beauty to the world."
"Here, this is one of my favourite scents," she said, sniffing a bright yellow rose hanging from the column beside her, "Ah.  See what you think of that."
Wyl leant forward and pretended to take a deep breath, suddenly wary lest the rose be a poison trap. "Mmmm, delicious.  You are clearly a very accomplished horticulturist."
They strolled together exploring the beautiful colours, textures and scents of the many and varied varieties within the garden.  Though he hadn't hitherto been interested in rose-growing, her passion and enthusiasm for the subject was infectious.  As they chatted, Wyl sensed a genuine warmth growing between them.  They talked of many things and found common delight in each other's anecdotes.  They found they shared a similar sense of humour that brought much laughter.
As they turned a corner, Wyl saw a small group of intense-blue climbing-roses in the border ahead.  They were twined around a group of stone statues, of children dancing in a circle. "Wow! They are incredible.  How did you get that colour?" he exclaimed.
"Wait until you smell the scent," she said, drawing one of the blue roses to his nose.
Wyl took the rose, but as he breathed its scent, he pricked his thumb on a thorn, "Ouch!"
A small drop of blood ran from his thumb.
"Here, let me," she said.
As she took his thumb between her luscious lips, they looked deep into each other's eyes.
"I... couldn't smell anything," Wyl said.
She sucked hard on his thumb for a moment, then slipped it from her warm, moist mouth.
"I smell the scent of my lost children," she said, with tears forming in her eyes.
The end of Wyl's thumb felt strangely numb. As he looked at it, he could see it had turned to stone, but he felt oddly detached and unalarmed; in fact, he felt slightly intoxicated.
"The statues?"
"Dead, but dreaming."
She held her hand to his cheek, still looking into his eyes, smiling sadly, "Sweet Wyl. We are so alike, you and I, both prisoners of our own dreams.  But is it truly a prison, where one accepts the confines and has no desire to leave?"
"You tricked me."
"You came here of your own free will, because I have something you need.  You knew the risks."
By now his whole arm was stone, "I suppose so."
The creeping fossilization was moving rapidly.  Wyl could barely breathe and his vision was blurred.  And yet he still thought she looked wonderful, all aglow within a charming pinkish haze.
He just managed to whisper, "Rose-coloured spectacles."
She smiled, "I will fulfil all of your deepest desires.  All things are possible within the vortex of our minds; dreams within dreams within dreams."
He blinked and she was gone, leaving only the warmth of her hand on his cheek.
In another moment, the rose garden dissolved into a bright haze... until...


Girl on a swing


  His heart missed a beat when he suddenly saw her; a girl on a swing, his lost love from many years ago. She was still ravishingly beautiful. She looked wise but not old; curvaceous but not heavy.  Time and his heartbeat seemed to slow, to the serene rhythm of her swinging. Her  bodice of silver filigree and delicate white lace hinted at her dark nipples beneath.  With each swing, her full bosom bobbed gently and her gossamer skirt fluttered behind her. Her smooth, olive skin looked edible.  Her full, plum lips were pouted, her eyes were dark and deep. Her nose was petite and cute. Her jet-black hair bobbed in slow motion, atop her swan-like neck, as she reached the zenith and it streamed back from her broad grin, as she arced downward again.  Swing.  Swing.  Swing.  Vivacious and vibrant, she made the enchantress seem plain by comparison.
  Though agog, he managed to stutter, "You're... still as beautiful... as I remember... you."
  "Thank you," she smiled, "I still wear the pendant you gave me, though who knows whether its magic still works, after all this time."
  "You bought it yourself, remember? One of many things I should have done.  I always was useless at buying gifts for you."
  "Well, it reminds me of you. Especially when I am feeling lonely."
  "Lonely? Surely not. You are so beautiful!"
  She slipped from the swing and skipped up to him.  As she brushed a lock of his hair from his forehead, she said, "I have tried others; they're just not you."
  He basked in the unwavering radiance of her smile.  Sensing her hot breath upon his lips, his mouth watered as he thought to kiss her. The old, deep feelings washed through him again, in wave after wave, as they always had whenever he was with her. The surging tide of warmth within him broke into a wide smile, as he pressed against her.
  "Oh beautiful, precious lady. Such sweet, sweet memories."
  "Yes, memories," she whispered breathlessly, as her wet tongue glossed her pouted lips.
  Their sultry gazes locked, they leant imperceptibly slowly together, until they could sense each others lips without actually touching, breathing each others breaths, melting into each others aura.
  "I could linger here for eternity."
  "But this isn't real."
  "I am so sorry, for all those forlorn hopes. You saw them for what they were, long before I did."
  "Goodbye, lovely man."
  "Goodbye, sweet lady."
  For a few moments of wonder filled reverie, he recalled the sensation of falling into the bright knowing that shone from her deep, dark eyes; the honeyed passion of her tender kisses; his soul resting safely in her embrace.
  He knew the dream was taking hold of all his faculties, but, he wondered, would it be so bad, to spend eternity within this dream?
"Oh sweet, sweet lady, how I have missed your heart, beating next to mine."
"We cannot be real though."
"We once shared a dream, perhaps we can share this one."
"Is it open, honest, fine, pure?"
"No.  But I am no longer certain that matters."
"Perhaps we will find such a dream one day," she whispered, with a tearful smile that said it did matter.
His eyes filled with tears too.
Then he felt himself falling away from her.  He could see her speaking, but could not catch her words. She ran towards him, but in slow time, so that they moved further apart.  She removed the pendant and threw it to him.  It twisted and turned through the air in slower and slower motion.  A bright fog swirled around her and she disappeared as he reached out to catch the pendant.


He was falling slowly and dizzily through luminous swirling clouds, for several moments.  Eventually, he fell out of the clouds and landed softly on his hands and knees, atop a warm sandy hill.  The haze cleared, to reveal a vast machine of shining, whirling metal, spread across the broad plain before him, like a great mechanical city. The air hummed and the ground throbbed in rhythm with its awesome dynamics.  He stood up, unsteadily at first, to look around.  Huge pistons thrust this way and that, while massive wheels and cogs spun and meshed.  The roar of the great engine washed through his soul like a mighty sacred river.


He began to notice subtle rhythms and beats; a sublime music that made him want to tap his feet and bob his head in time. He began a cadenced walk toward the mechanistic metropolis, but the walk soon became a joyful dance!
  Very soon, he stood next to a great whirling armature and placed his hand upon the huge metallic beam that supported it. Within the tumult of harmonic vibrations that coursed through his fingertips, he sensed a vague arrhythmia. As he focused on the disharmony, it grew into a cry from within the great machine. It called to his soul; a mournful plea for mechanical healing. His engineer's instincts were already formulating ideas on the cause of the problem. He knew he could fix it. He knew it would need a lot of work; perhaps it would be the work of a lifetime, but he was just the one to do it! It was an engineer's dream. How he wished his father were here with him now; they would work on it together until their knuckles bled oil.
  Then, off in the distance, made hazy by the exhaust gases of the great machine, Wyl could just make out a familiar figure, stooped intently over a stuttering mechanism.
 "Dad? Dad!"
  He ran towards the man, who looked round as he approached and then stood square and tall. The man smiled and held his arms wide open.
"My son! At last, you've come to help me," he said, his voice filled with warmth and gratitude, "I have toiled alone for so long."
Wyl jumped into that strong embrace and was held there, tight and warm as the air throbbed with the thunderous grand opera of the great machine. Wyl felt so at home in that strong embrace. So loved. So cherished. Ding-a-ling. Ding-a-ling. Ding-a-ling. The alarm clock!


He was wrenched painfully from the dream and back to reality. His eyes filled with tears as the vision of his father faded. Instead, he was confronted by the enchantress in her true harpy form. Caught by surprise, she hissed and screeched in rage as she flapped her shimmering feather wings, furiously trying to take off, while slashing at him with her talons.
Her fury was matched by an explosive hatred that fired Wyl into instant action.  He caught her full-on with his Frost Nova and froze her to the spot.  Then he hurled fireball after fireball, seething with a vicious determination to obliterate her!  He realised he still had the pendant in his hand, so he stuffed it into his pack, then grabbed his wand and took aim.  But the harpy was already defeated by the ferocity of his attack.  She lay crumpled on the floor, her beautiful plumage frazzling in the flames.  Seeing her there, broken and twisted, his hatred was extinguished by a flood of remorse at what he had done and how he had felt.  He cast an ice-spell to douse the flames; she lay there steaming and choking, blackened and singed.
She turned her sooty face up to him, with those wide eyes filled with the deep sadness of a mother mourning her children, "Quickly, lay me with my little ones.  Please," she coughed.
Wyl hurriedly cast his trinket levitation spell and lifted her into the rose bower, lowering her gently to the ground.  The roses wrapped around her.  As the thorns bit her flesh, small rivulets of blood ran down to the rich soil.  As her flesh began to crystallize to stone, she heaved a sigh and smiled.
Suddenly, as if from nowhere, the rogue appeared!  With a single swish of her dagger, she cut out the harpy's tongue.
"Did you forget what you came for?" she admonished as she displayed the bloody trophy.
Wyl looked down at the harpy.  Her bloody grimace was set in stone.
"Quick! The jar!" shouted the rogue.
Wyl pulled the jar from his pack and popped up the lid.  The rogue dropped the tongue into the potion and Wyl quickly replaced the lid and put the jar back into his pack.
"And what did you come for?"
"Well, I figured there'd be rich pickings."
"Help yourself," Wyl said dismissively.
"I intend to."
As the rogue wandered back into the house, Wyl stood in a daze, while the recent events tumbled haphazardly through his mind.  He felt physically and emotionally exhausted.  He went in search of somewhere to sleep.  He flopped face down onto the first bed he found, but his whirling brain wouldn't let him sleep.  His journey suddenly seemed pointless.  He now had both tongues, but he didn't feel excited about the prospect of selling them any more.  He just wanted to go home.  Home; where his mother would be worrying about him.  He sat up and rummaged through his pack until he found the Dreamcaster Orb.  He would send his mother a dream, to let her know he was alive and well.  But each time he tried, the images that appeared within the orb were of charred harpies, vampire roses and bloody tongues.  He couldn't send those dreams to his mother.  He looked around the room, at the carved bed frame, the flowery quilt, the ornate windows, the plain walls, a tapestry on the wall which was just an indistinct pattern from where he sat.  Nothing to inspire a pleasant dream.  He almost gave up and was sat there thinking he could do with one of his mum's hugs, when a vision appeared in the glass, of him standing behind his mother and wrapping his arms tight around her.  She sank into him and smiled so warmly.  He smiled back and rested his chin on her shoulder, so they stood cheek to cheek.  The image within the orb swirled and shone brighter as the dream was cast, then it faded back to clear glass.  Wyl returned the orb to his pack and then lay back on the bed, feeling calm and sleepy now.  As his eyelids grew heavy, he made a mental note to give his mum a real hug, the next time he saw her.


The pleasant images of home faded as he fell into a fitful sleep.  He dreamt he was free-falling into a bottomless shaft; twisting into nether darkness.  The face of the rogue swam before him, coming and going as he kept spinning around and ever downward.
She kept repeating the same words over and over, "You go on your way and I'll go mine.  You go on your way and I'll go mine.  You go on your way and I'll go mine."
And all the while, he could hear the familiar echoes of a pick clanging on hard rock.
Then the face of the rogue was replaced by the face of the old witch, Eweline, at their last meeting in her old queerly angled house.
"And what other profession have you chosen?" she quizzed.
"Jewel-crafting."
She looked down her long nose with that piercing gaze for which she is renowned, "Mmmm, gnomes are not noted for their skill with gems.  Your engineering is entirely appropriate, but, jewel-crafting?  I sense... a penance, for some error."
"Penance?" he sighed wistfully, "I live in hope that I'll get the chance to make good my error."
"Ah, missed chances.  Don't let them cloud fresh opportunities, young mage.  I sense there is much good in you.  Sow it liberally, then it will grow abundantly around you."
“Perhaps.  I sometimes wish I could erase the past and start again.”
“The past is already erased, young mage.  We each have our imperfect memories of it, but they are all that remains.”
“Nevertheless, I am unhappy with the future to which my past has brought me.”
“You seek a new future?”
“Yes.”
“You have such regrets?”
“Yes.  No, actually, no, not regrets;  I am cursed.”
“Cursed?”
“By an undying love.”
“I see.  Well then, perhaps I have an errand that might help you find a cure...”


Suddenly the dream changed; Wyl and Eweline were standing together in the garden of the enchantress, surrounded by the statues of the lost children and the parasitic roses.  Eweline held a Dreamcaster Orb in her hand, "Listen carefully Wyl."
Wyl looked at her stern face.
"You must go on, further west.  The errand is not yet done."
"I want to go home."
"Take heart.  What you do is a good thing and I chose you with care, for this is a very important task.  Leave the Isle of Disenchantment and cross the westward strait to the far coast."
"But, I have the tongue you wanted.  In fact, I have the pair."
"I didn't say I wanted the tongues."
"Oh, yes, that's right.  The leprechaun didn't want it either."
"It is you who needs the tongues.  Go west, young mage.  All will become clear.  Take care."
"But..." Wyl began to respond but his feet felt wet so he looked down.  The garden was filling with water!  He looked up, but Eweline was gone.
Suddenly, Wyl awoke, lying on the bed and staring at the ceiling, "Ah, just a dream."
But then he realised he really was wet.  He sat bolt upright.  The room really was filling with water.  He jumped off the bed and waded out of the house.  The sea was returning!  The nearest boat to the house was a three masted frigate.  He summoned his mount and raced towards it.


RUM CURIO


Once there, he clambered up some loose rigging onto the slightly inclined main deck, then sat on the gunwale to catch his breath.  The whole landscape was rapidly filling with water; small skiffs and dinghies were already floating about.  Wyl was just beginning to realise he wouldn't be able to sail the frigate single-handed, when his thoughts were rudely interrupted by a loud coarse yelling.
"Avast there, ye landlubber!  What ye doin' aboard me vessel, all uninvited like?"
Wyl stood speechless, looking at the scruffy bearded pirate with a cutlass in one hand and a rum bottle in the other.
"Speak up!  Hic!  It's the brig for thee, if ye cannot show just cause why ye be aboard!" shouted the pirate, swaying unsteadily and waving the cutlass at Wyl's throat.
"I... brought you the sea!" Wyl bluffed, as loudly as the pirate.
The drunken pirate blinked and staggered over to the gunwale.  He lifted his cap and stroked his shiny pate, "The sea!  Well I'll swear by the gods o' the Naga, ye brought the sea!"
He turned to Wyl with tears of deep gratitude filling his eyes, then looked again at the rising waters.  With a mighty grin he spun around and did a whirling drunken jig up the tilted deck, singing loudly:


If I had the heart and wings
Of the pure and noble gryphon,
I'd carry her away with me;
My love amongst the Elven,
With her olive skinned breasts
And hair as black as the raven.


With happiness she'd mount me,
As I would be happily ridden;
Across the whole world we'd fly,
To my mountain eyrie haven,
Where we would build our nest,
To be resurrected and forgiven.


Suddenly, a nearby deck-hatch flew open with a crash and a very irate pirate wench marched across the deck and tipped a large pan of clam chowder over the pirates head!
"I'll give yer 'elven love', yer chuffin' swine!" she shouted.
She turned to glare at Wyl, her eyes like fire-emeralds and her hair of golden flame seeming animated even in the windless air. Her look softened and she gave Wyl a secret wink before she stormed back below decks, slamming the hatch as she went.
"Well aren't we bloody alright," said the dripping pirate as clam meat and seaweed slipped down his face.


The ship suddenly lurched upright with a horrendous creaking as the rising water floated her off the sand.  The pirate fell hard on his backside and roared with laughter.
Then he struggled to his feet and swayed as the ship pitched about, "Bah, me old sea legs is grown wobbly in this confounded dessert!"
"Well, you are as pissed as a f..."
"I'll 'ave ye keep a civil tongue when thee addressin' the cap'n!  Three sheets to the wind, if ye don't mind."
"Aye, aye, cap'n."
"That's better, shipmate.  Now, let's put some wind in us riggin'!"
Wyl looked up to see the masts bore little more than a few shreds of sail, "Wind?  Don't we need sails?"
"Aharrgh, young lad, I'll 'ave 'er sailin' faster 'an the wind.  Thee just see'f I don't, or my name ain't Cap'n 'Typhoon' Morgan!"
The pirate ran to the foot of the mainmast, took a black flag from the nearby locker and began to hoist it high.  It dangled limp in the dry windless air.  Still, the captain pulled and pulled on the rope until the flag hung lifeless from the top of the mast.  He cleated the rope and then staggered across the deck and up the steps to the poop-deck.  He slipped his cutlass into his waistband, but kept tight hold of his rum bottle.  With his free hand he took hold of the ship's wheel and looked up at the flag.  He tipped his head right back and guzzled several gulps of rum, before imparting a long, deep, rumbling belch.
Then he yelled, "All hands on the wheel!  She's gonna blow!"
Wyl took another look at the motionless flag, but decided he better humour the old sot.  He went to stand beside the captain and held the wheel.  Even as he took his stand, he felt a breath of wind.
"'Ere matey, 'ave a few swigs o' Everlast Rum.  Get drunk and it makes yer immortal!"
"Immortal, really?"
"Aye lad, so long as yer stay at least two sheets, I reckon.  I sure ain't dead yet 'n' I sure does feel immortal.  I lost count o' the years I been a suppin' from this bottle.  Though maybe I won't feel like livin' for ever, if I 'ave to suffer the 'angover!" he roared with laughter.
Then he took another long swig before offering the bottle to Wyl.  Wyl took a small drink and his throat burned.
"Wind's picking up," he coughed and spluttered.
He offered the bottle back but the captain said, "Nay lad, get it down ye,  storm's a brewin'!"
Reluctantly Wyl took a couple more swigs, which to his relief weren't quite as bad as the first.  As he forced down the last, he saw the flag flutter and then lift.  It bore a white skull and two crossed rum bottles on a black field.  He handed the bottle back to the captain while watching the flag stiffen in the freshening breeze.  To his amazement, the ship began to move, even without sails!
"How can we be moving?"
"Well," began the pirate in a conspiratorial whisper, "it's all on account o' a galleon we plundered, on the South Seas.  Back in the day, there was rich pickin's in them there waters.  Runnin' low 'n' slow she was, wi' so much gold aboard.  Aye lad, we wenched 'n' feasted for months in Booty Bay, on the strength o' that one prize.  Well, we'd fed most o' the crew to the fishes, but for one big surly lookin' orc.  A fright to behold 'e was, wi' scars all over an' tattoos on 'is teeth, I swear!  The first mate took aim at 'is ugly 'ead, wi' 'is trusty pistol.  We all saw the flash an' the smoke, an' heard the crack an' whistle o' the shot leave the muzzle.  He missed!  From five yards!  Yet the orc hadn't flinched.  The first mate reloaded twice more an' fired twice more, the last from point blank, but the orc was unmoved an' unmarked!  Well, we wus all sayin' our prayers, but no man were for givin' up the booty.  So, we binds the orc up tight an' set sail for a quiet bay where we could offload.  But within two bells, the first mate fell out o' the crows nest an' lay dead broke on the deck.  An' we wus stuck dead in the doldrums to-boot.  We's all afeared the orc's cursed us.  But what to do?  Well bless me if the orc don't just sit up an' call on some orcish shaman magic.  The first mate rises up, looking a bit bent, but alive again.  Then the orc lays down some totem an' calls the spirit o' the wind.  We then sails at six knots, wi' the sea like a mill pond around us, 'til we reaches airier climes and the natural wind fills our sails.  Well, some o' the crew still wanted rid, an'  are gettin' skittery like, wi' night comin' on an' all.  We's at the bay by sundown, so I sits wi' the orc, an' even without a common lingo, we manages to do a deal; gold talks!  Then the shaman just leaves, 'ee don't need no boat see, 'e jus' walks atop the waves, an' disappears into the darkness.  I takes the totem, an' nails it outta sight under the prow, so as it don't scare the crew like.  An' I 'as the secret, in me 'ead.  Since that day, the Rum Curio don't need no sails; just the sea beneath 'er."
Then the captain looked around, as if to make sure no one else was listening.  He took a hard swig on the rum bottle, "Trouble is, I sometimes overdo it."
"Overdo it?"
"Aye matey.  That belch was a tad longer than I was intendin', so we're gonna get a lot o' wind."
"Oh no."
"Aye, ye'll soon see why me shipmates called me, 'Typhoon'!"
Sure enough, Wyl felt a stiff cooling breeze on his back and the ship began to make headway.  He looked around and was astonished to see a dark cloud astern.  It was swirling and billowing rapidly and even as he watched a water-spout formed beneath it.  The wind grew steadily stronger as the cloud mushroomed upward, high into the sky.  Lightning flickered within the cloud and a second later deep thunder rumbled.  The wind was whipping up white horses on the sea and the ship began to pitch from side to side.  A squall front formed ahead of the cloud which was speedily filling the sky above them.  The sky grew darker until suddenly, a chill rain lashed across the deck.  The ship was heaving now and the thunder and lightning was almost continuous.  Wyl and the Captain hung onto the wheel as the ship suddenly lurched forward so fast, it almost swept them off their feet!  Soon, the force of the wind was such that it threatened to blow them overboard.  The rain fell in sheets and the visibility dropped to just a few yards.  The waves were coming over the prow now and the decks were awash.  Wyl felt the Captain tie him to the wheel with a rope and turned to look into his sodden, toothless grin.  He was relishing this! He mouthed his thanks; shouting seemed pointless in the din of the storm.  The prow of the ship suddenly rose into a wave that looked like a fifty-foot wall of water ahead of them.  Wyl felt sure the ship would turn-turtle, but the Rum Curio ploughed down through the huge wave, storm lashed but proud.


At that moment, the hatch crashed open and the Captain's sea-wife reappeared, waving a large iron pan.  Despite the wild pitching of the deck, she determinedly made her way to the starboard ladder to the poop deck.
The Captain looked at Wyl and rolled his eyes upwards, “Oops, forgot to warn the missus.”  Then he scurried down the ladder opposite to the one his sea-wife was ascending and quickly climbed the port ratlines up to the crows-nest.  His sea-wife gave chase, still waving the pan threateningly.  Though the storm still raged, Wyl was more worried about what the sea-wife would do to the Captain, if she caught him.  As she neared the crow’s nest, the Captain shimmied down the starboard ratlines and ran to the foredeck.


Suddenly, a ray of sunshine cut through the mist and spray, bathing the deck in a golden glow.  The wind dropped rapidly and the storm abated.  The rain became just a few spots and a rainbow formed over the vessel.  Wyl heaved a sigh of relief.  The Captain disappeared into the forecastle and his sea-wife followed him.


The cloud and the rainbow very quickly evaporated, to leave crystal clear blue sky once again.  Wyl untied himself and shook the water off as best he could.  There was still a stiff breeze, presumably supernatural, so the Rum Curio was still making good, without canvas aloft.  The sea spray was now clearing to reveal a gently rippling sea and, jagged rocks ahead!


Wyl ran forward into the forecastle to find the Captain, hoping he hadn't been bashed unconscious.  He found the Captain and his sea-wife embracing each other and kissing passionately.  The iron pan lay discarded by their feet.  When their hands began to wander south, Wyl coughed to get their attention.  But the kissing continued.
“I think we're heading for rocks,” Wyl said, in an embarrassed whisper.
The kissing still continued and the hands were heading for the tropics.
Wyl shouted as loud as he could, “All hands on deck!  Land ho!”
That got their attention; they both rushed out on deck, giggling and holding hands. Wyl followed.  The Captain uttered a few orcish words under his breath and the ship slowed.  He ran up to the poop deck and took the wheel.  Wyl joined the Captain, while his sea-wife went below.


“Dangerous waters these,” said the Captain, “I reckon that be the western shore o' the Sea o' Dreams.”
Wyl followed the Captain's gaze and saw a distant strip of beach, then said, “That's where I want to land.”
“I won't be takin' 'er in much closer lad, I don't know these 'ere waters.  You can row in; I'll let thee take a dinghy.”
“Thank you Captain, that is most gracious.”
“Nay shipmate! I thank thee kindly; I never thought to see ol' briny again.”
“Ha ha! I'll bet ol' briny missed you too, cap'n.”
“Aye, 'appen she did, ha hargh!”
The Captain stepped forward and gave Wyl a warm hug.”
“Now, get below for some chow, while I sling the dinghy!”
“Aye aye, cap'n.”


Within the hour, Wyl was waving goodbye to Captain 'Typhoon' Morgan and his sea-wife, full-fed and watered. He drew steadily on the oars and the Rum Curio soon seemed small and distant. The water lapped gently against the dinghy. The sea was serenely calm and a sense of peace fell upon him. He dreamed of home.  He recollected a time in his mother's kitchen, many years ago when he was just an apprentice...
It was her birthday and she was singing as she baked a cake. He ran up to her, feeling very proud of the fact that he had finally mastered sufficient magical skill, to make for her a special birthday present.
"Happy birthday Mum!" he said putting the small jar on the table, "It's Unwrinkle Cream, it straightens out your skin, your head and your life!"
"You cheeky thing!" she cried in mock shock. Then laughing, she chased him around the kitchen table until she caught him and then tickled and hugged him.
"Do you like your present?", he asked, once he stopped laughing and got his breath back.
She looked wistfully at the jar, "Oh yes, but I'll keep it for a very, very special day."
Then she popped it into the rack alongside her cooking spices and said, "Let's go buy pizza!"


Wyl was suddenly shaken from his reverie by the thud of something against the boat. He looked around and saw a dark shape drifting away astern. He kept on rowing and the indeterminate shape disappeared into the distance. The Rum Curio was gone over the horizon. Then there was another thud. He shipped the oars and looked over the side.
"Ugh!" he gasped as he came face to face with a fishy-eyed corpse. It was vaguely humanoid but too rotten to classify clearly. It drifted astern so he took up the oars and carried on rowing.
 Then there was a double thud. He dug the oars in to stop the boat. He looked over the side again, expecting to see a corpse this time. There were three. Two were Murloc, the mottled semi-humanoid amphibians that were common in watery places. The other corpse, was a gnome!
He quickly resumed rowing until soon the boat was being bumped frequently by floating corpses. Wyl noted many races among them, from humans to orcs.  On he went.  Collisions with floating corpses became more and more frequent until the sea surface was almost hidden by cadavers and the rowing was becoming very tiring.  The stench got increasingly acrid, until it became unbearable.  He shipped the oars and scrabbled around in his backpack until he found the Necromancer's Nosegay and slipped it over his face. "Ahh, the scents of a spring meadow."
Just as he was closing his backpack, he noticed the pendant his long lost love had thrown to him, when he was within the dream house of the enchantress.  He took it out and looked at it more closely.  It was the shape of a crescent moon and the gems on it were glowing faintly.
He mumbled, "If this is here now, she must have been real too, no mere figment of a dream?"
He looked again at the pendant, then he held it to his forehead, to explore it with his magi sensibilities.  He sensed an enchantment; it could be used to reanimate a corpse, "Reanimate a corpse!"
Tears filled his eyes as he cried out loud to the heavens, "Gods answer me!  Is she dead?"
The gods, and the crowd of floating cadavers, answered not.  A tiny warming spark within him, was suddenly snuffed out.  He mulled over his memories of her, memories that were now firmly in the past.  He cast his gaze over the sea of dead around him, a sea of lost hopes.


He recalled some advice from an old friend, a renowned healer and master of elemental magic.  Staring out to sea from atop the coastal cliff, the wizened old shaman had remarked, "See the clouds?  Heed them well, for they tell you what tomorrow brings; whether it will be warm or cold, stormy or sunny.  Left alone, nature will unfold exactly as it should.  And when you look deep into a woman's eyes, heed the clouds there too, but, take care to nurture the unfolding."
“And if I see anger in those eyes?”
“What is anger? It is a cry from our spirit to resolve something that has defeated our reason; it is irrational by nature.  Like all emotions, it is a wisp.  Listen now, to the sea; it slowly washes away the ancient rocks upon which we stand and the fossils within.  But those fossils are merely the remains of the empty shells; that which animated them has long since ceased to be.”
“Then may the gods grant me a heart of stone.”
“Do not wish for that my friend, for then your life would be as dead and empty as these fossils.”


As the boat bobbed gently, Wyl looked up into the featureless grey mist.
“I am not dead yet!" he shouted defiantly at the insouciant gods.
He looked over the side of the boat for something that looked vaguely humanoid.  There were several to choose from, amongst several that he didn't care to look at too closely. Wyl dragged one with an oar until it bobbed against the boat. Then, he cast his trinket levitation spell to lift it from the water and dropped it into the stern. It was partly decomposed, but looked like it had all its parts.
He slipped the pendant over the head of the slumped corpse. The three red jewels of the pendant glowed repeatedly in sequence for a few moments. Eventually, the corpse began to twitch and disgusting slurping sounds emanated from it, like inward farting! The decrepit flesh began to firm up. The eyeball that hung by threads on the right cheek, slurped back up into it's socket, with a loud pop! The corpse righted itself and blinked. Then it inhaled a long, deep breath, causing its ribs to crack loudly, as its chest expanded, making Wyl wince. Then it violently coughed up sea water for several minutes, until it finally sat upright and looked straight at Wyl.
"Considering how long you must have been in the water, you don't look half bad."
"There is plenty of other fish-food floating about round here."
"Yes, I noticed. What was your name?"
"I am Krendal, the warrior."
"I am Wyl, the mage. You're from the Exodar?"
"Aye, a long time ago."
"So, what took place here?"
"You don't know?"
"No, I never passed this way before."
"Then turn the boat around and go back to where you came from."
"I have to complete a quest."
"An entire army perished here!  This place is accursed."
"Nevertheless. Take my place and row, I intend to go on."
"As you command."
They carefully moved around each other in the boat and Wyl sat at the stern as Krendal took the oars and began to row. The powerful Draenei made much better headway than Wyl had been able to.
They travelled through the mists for about half an hour before the warrior spoke again, "How long will my resurrection last?"
"As long as you wear that pendant, you will be alive, sort of. Remove it and you will die. I will let you keep it until we get to the far shore."
"Would you consider letting me use it for longer? I have unfinished business there."
"I hope you're not planning on visiting any past lovers, you look pretty gruesome."
"No, it's revenge. If you help me exact it, it could work in your favour."
"How?"
"You're going to the Black Citadel, are you not?"
"To tell the truth, all I know for sure is that I must go west.  I have to complete a quest, yet I have only a vague dream fragment relating it's purpose and my part in it."
"I would be a very powerful ally.  And my friend, you may have given me the edge in death, I never had in life. I came here as part of an army. Our enemies were well prepared for an army. But perhaps now, drunk upon their victory, they will fall victim to a subtler attack."
"A berserking, undead, Draenei warrior... subtle?"
"Ha ha! Perhaps not. I just need to get within striking distance of the Arcanist, somehow, before he has a chance to summon demonic help through his portal."
“Arcanist? Portal?  Of course, portal. I think maybe I have an edge too," said Wyl, as he rummaged about in his backpack.
Krendal watched as Wyl unfolded an old, tattered copy of the Journal of the Thirsty Chemical Society, to reveal a small black stone carving, of a snake swallowing its own tail, "This is the Ouroboros of Benzol.  A teacher of mine once took me on a boost through a dungeon, where this dropped after a frantic fight, with a mass of serpent-worshipping, alchemist sorcerers.  She made me promise never to dispose of it.  So, even though I couldn't figure out what use it might be, I kept it."
"And what does it do?" said Krendal.
"It allows me to tune-in to any portal, within a short range, and reverse teleport something out of it."
"What range?"
“My teacher made me practice over and over, teleporting sheep from Elwynn Forest to the Mage District of Stormwind, through a portal she had cast there.  I got so bored, I played a little joke on her,” Wyl sniggered.
“What joke?” smiled Krendal.
“I sent her a sheep that wasn't a sheep; a wolf in sheep's clothing, you might say.”
Krendal laughed loudly.
Wyl went on, “She killed the wolf easily of course, as soon as it transformed from sheep back to wolf, but it did make her jump.”
They both chuckled at the thought.
“So, if I get close enough, I should be able to teleport myself straight into the heart of the Black Citadel."
"I have a better idea. Why don't you teleport a berserking, undead, Draenei warrior instead? Imagine the look on the acolytes faces!"
They both roared so much with laughter, that they almost capsized the boat! And perhaps they would have, if the boat hadn't finally beached.
"I guess we walk from here," said Wyl.
They slipped out of the boat into knee deep water. Krendal pushed through the floating corpses and Wyl followed in his wake. Before long they were having to walk over the slimy bodies, slipping and sliding, to reach the dry sand.  The beach itself was littered with countless dead.  As they headed inland, the fog began to lift and thin, until it floated like a shroud over the unbroken field of the fallen.  Although it was a scene of terrible carnage, Wyl saw too, an obscene beauty; it was as if the hand of a great artist had wrought the lifeless clay, the mist and the light into a perfect composition.  A glimpse of a dream flit through his memory, and with it, came a deep conviction that he was meant to be here.  His feelings of horror and disgust were displaced by a gentle calm.


The mist began to clear ahead. As Wyl looked up the beach he could see nothing but corpses upon corpses. Many were badly mutilated, with bones and skulls exposed. As they continued inland, up a shallow cliff, the sea-mist evaporated and they stood in baking sunshine. Here, the corpses wriggled incessantly with charnel worms and dense clouds of flies buzzed and swirled around everywhere.


The hill of corpses rose before them until they saw, beyond it, in the far distance, a great fortress in the shape of a shiny obsidian skull. Where its top teeth would have been, were the bars of a massive portcullis. A tall pointed tower rose like a huge spear shaft from the top of the skull, high into the clear blue sky.


Just ahead of where they stood, the sun glinted brightly on something metallic, held within the fist of a stocky dwarven forearm, that stood defiantly out from a mound of corpses.
"Look, he took at least a dozen of the enemy with him!" said Krendal, as they stopped by the mound of twisted, tangled and battered cadavers.
Wyl looked down at the face of the corpse holding the shiny object. Ironically, the face of the fallen soldier smiled sardonically back in death. His face was as yet ungnawed by the worms and he still looked young, bold and handsome; a valiant visage that would grace any memorial to a heroic victory. Wyl suddenly felt sad. He let his gaze sweep around over the countless dead that now surrounded them on all sides, "What in the name of the gods happened here?"
"War; No matter how nobly it begins, it always looks this way in the end."
Wyl pulled the shiny object from the dead dwarf's hand; it was a bejewelled locket. His magi instincts sensed no intrinsic magic, but there was a faint ghostly aura. He popped open the locket to reveal the image of a pretty, happy, dwarven maiden.
The tears welled up in Wyl's eyes as he focussed on the aura and recounted its tale to Krendal, "When he realised he was facing defeat, he bellowed a curse upon his enemies, then cast aside his bloodied war hammer, which hadn't left his side since the day his father bestowed it upon him, at the Great Forge.  He took hold of the locket hanging from his neck, where she had placed it with a kiss, on the day he marched out. Then laughing, he cried out her name, as their weapons pierced his armour. With his final breath, he thanked her for her love, as he raised his fist into the air."
With a heavy sigh, Wyl replaced the locket, "It must be true, what they say; that the Golden Age is over.  All the heroes are dead."
Krendal put his hands on Wyl's shoulders and stooped to look deep into his eyes. Then he said solemnly, "I too thought all the brightest and the best had died on this blasted shore. But no. All is now clear; my rebirth is no accident. The gods have brought us together. I will fulfil my warrior destiny after all."
"Warrior destiny?"
Krendal stood tall and looked into the bright sky, "Powerful runes were cast upon my birth. Portents that foretold I would fight and serve at the right hand of a future king; the king of the Second Golden Age. So, as I drowned beneath the weight of my foes in this accursed sea, without even letting blood in the citadel itself, the tragedy of my unfulfilled destiny beat me down, more assuredly than the swords and axes of my adversaries. With all of our knights and princes, savants and sages, slain around me, what meaning was there left to my existence? None, it seemed."
"What are you talking about?  I am no king!"
"We took down thousands upon thousands of the Legion and all their hellish demons! But they were too many and too strong.  We represented the combined might and magic of the Alliance and the Horde, yet we could not withstand the onslaught.  And, you have released me from the curse."
"The Legion? The Burning Legion?! When was this?"
"When? Oh, show me your astrolabe."
With an impatient click of his fingers, Wyl conjured a hologram of the current position of the planets.
After studying it for a moment, Krendal said, "Oh! About a hundred years ago!"
Wyl dismissed the astrolabe in an irritated manner and glared at the huge Draenei with his hands on his hips, "Why are all these bodies still here, not even half rotted?"
"The battle is not over.  It is a conflict of the cursed.  You brought me back from a ghostly battlefield in limbo, where I thought we and our fallen enemies were condemned to continue fighting for eternity."
Wyl looked towards the citadel.
"Look," continued the Draenei, becoming equally irritated, "we didn't win the battle here, but neither did they, otherwise all of Azeroth would be ravaged by demons and hell-fire by now. Maybe you could be just a little grateful for that!"
"So why haven’t I heard tales of it before, longshanks?!"
"Because no one lived to tell the tale, shorty! They fight on, even in death."
"Come to think of it, there is a legend I vaguely recall, of an army that ventured out never to return. The legend says they will reappear when the kingdoms are once again in mortal danger. But then, the legends always say that.  Hey, big guy, I guess you're it!"
Krendal hissed through his teeth, "You're right about one thing, you're no king. Nevertheless, I will serve you. Maybe you will be a king one day."
"Oh sure."
"When you grow up!" shouted the Draenei.
"Yeah! A king with a one-man army!" Wyl shouted back.
They stood in furious silence for a few moments, until Krendal suddenly stared at Wyl, mouth agape.
"What is it?" said Wyl.
As he relaxed, Krendal said, "Brave comrade, it would have been an honour to fight at your side, but I am afraid our friendship will be cut short."
"Why? Aren't you coming with me to the citadel?"
"I should have thought of it before.  There is one here who should go in my place, if we can find him.  He should wear your magic pendant and be your one man army."
"But..."
"Yes, I know.  I will have to give up my new-found life, which suddenly seems so very sweet, and return to the battlefield of the damned. Nevertheless, there is another more worthy."
"And who might that be?"
"The King himself. No mightier warrior has yet drawn breath. And, he is a great warlord of consummate skill in both tactics and strategy.  He will help you in ways I cannot.  In this way perhaps, my destiny is fulfilled after all."
"Very well, if we can find him," said Wyl, surveying the vast sprawl of cadavers, "That won't be easy."
"I think I know where to look," said Krendal, looking toward the citadel.
Wyl followed his gaze.
"See that small knoll, piled high with dead and topped with a copse of rusty spears and tattered banners?"
"Yes, I see it."
"Come."
Wyl followed the big Draenei as they stumbled across the field of bodies. Within ten minutes they stood at the foot of the knoll.  It was clear a terrific fight had taken place around the hillock by the sheer number of demonic corpses that surrounded it.  But the corpses strewn across the crest of the small hill were mostly from the races of Azeroth.  Chief amongst them lay the massive body of the dead king, who stood out from even this assembly of boldly chiselled champions.


"This is goodbye then," said the Draenei sadly, as he stooped and lifted Wyl from the ground.  They hugged warmly, then Krendal put Wyl gently down, smiling through his sparkling tears.  Krendal sat down beside the corpse of the king.
"Tell him, I served him with honour, to the end."
"I will."
"Good fortune, my friend."
Without hesitation, Krendal lifted the pendant over his head and immediately gagged and slumped forward, stiff and unmoving.  Although he'd hardly known him, Wyl felt as if he'd lost a brother.  A sudden chill breeze ruffled the big man's hair.  Wyl squatted beside him and looked into the lifeless eyes for a few moments.
As he took the pendant from the Draenei's dead grasp, he whispered softly, "Goodbye, my friend.  May the spirit-healer spare you the eternal battle and speed you to your ancestors."
He stood and watched as grains of sand, lifted by the wind, collected in the folds of the dead warrior's clothing.  He suddenly felt very, very alone and longed for home.  He recalled his mother's warm smile, which he missed so very much.  He looked back towards the sea and thought of abandoning the quest and returning home.  Then he looked back at the dead Draenei.
"For you, brother in arms, for you.  And for Eweline."
Wyl thought of the old witch, to whom he had promised he would complete this quest.  She had taught him so much.  He recalled their last meeting, just before he set out on the quest.  They had said their goodbyes and as Wyl was leaving, he turned to give her a final wave.  But an owl flew in through the window, hung for a moment on a breath of air, then with a flash, transformed into a tall, ruggedly-handsome night-elf druid.  Eweline smiled sweetly and held out her hands, which the druid took into his, also smiling.  She blossomed upon his touch and a  thousand years of weariness fell away from her.  The way they looked at each other, with such deep affection, made Wyl momentarily jealous.  Even old people, he realised, can fall deeply in love.


He looked down at the corpse of the King, "I hope you're at least half the man Krendal thought you were."
Wyl held the head of the King with one hand and slipped the pendant over his head with the other.  He stepped back as the pendant gems flickered.
The King leapt to his feet and roared!  For a moment, Wyl thought the King would attack him with his huge two-handed sword.  Then the King relaxed and spoke to Wyl with a surprisingly gentle voice, “Greetings, Wyl of Ironforge.”
“Have we met?”
“This moment was shown to me in a scrying bowl, when I was but a boy.  Though much about you remained in shadow, all the seers linked my destiny with thine.  My mother would recount tales of your legendary deeds as she put me to bed.  As I grew, I was inspired by your courage and your heart.  Now at last, I meet the legend.”
“But, I haven't performed any great deeds.”
“Ha ha!” the King laughed, as he patted Wyl on the back, “Starting today, we write your legend into the history books of Azeroth, from where it will inspire future kings and kingdoms to greatness!”
The King lifted his sword behind him and sheathed it on his back, “And Krendal too, whose honour and bravery are well known to us.  Now, let us find my dear queen.  She lies somewhere on this battlefield.”
“Yes, your majesty.”


SUZZE


They searched for an hour before they came across the Queen.  She was lashed to a wooden post that had once stood vertical, but that now lay on the hot sand.  Grim faced and silent, the King cut the bindings and lay her softly on the ground.  Wyl watched in silence as the King knelt over his consort.  She must once have been very beautiful, but now, her face and body were dry and brittle, sorely ravaged by time and the elements and who knows what demonic torments.  The mighty warlord cupped her face in his massive hands, as gently as if she was a delicate bird.  He put his lips to what was left of hers.  Then, as tears trickled down his cheeks, he kissed her slowly and passionately.  Without breaking the kiss, he took hold of the pendant around his neck and lifted it over his head.
"Your Majesty!" Wyl shouted in alarm.
But the king took no notice as he slipped the pendant over the head of his beloved.  The head of the King suddenly shot back as he was racked by the grimaced agony of his death throes.  Then the air hissed from between his lips as his head slowly sank onto the bosom of his queen.  He lay there dead and still, the death pallor restored.
The pendant flickered and its enchantment brought the dead queen to life with a start.  Her eyes blinked open and her bosom heaved as she inhaled a deep breath. Her skin grew firm and supple across her form and a mistletoe wreath grew like a crown upon her head.  She raised her hands and placed them gently on the head of her dead king.  With a slight but deeply affectionate smile, she stroked his hair softly.
Then she bit on her lip as tears streamed down her face, "Oh my darling, must we spend another eternity apart?"
She stroked him and kissed him and rocked him in her arms, weeping all the while.  Finally, she laid him gently on his back and folded his arms across his chest.  He looked the epitome of the fallen hero.  She put one last lingering kiss upon his lips and then got unsteadily to her feet.


Looking into the sky, she said, "Have no fear, young mage.  The alignment is at hand."
Wyl looked up but saw nothing except blue sky and a hot afternoon sun.
She looked down at the body of the King, although her gaze seemed somehow distant, "Serve him well.  And when you next meet my grand daughter, tell her that above all the tales of epic deeds, I would have her remember that I was once dearly loved by a good man, as he was loved by me."
Then she lifted one hand straight into the air and a small blue flame flickered at her fingertips.  The flame grew into an ectoplasmic aura that streamed up into the sky, higher and higher and higher, until it seemed to touch the sun itself.
There was a distant rumble, then the earth began to shake violently.  Wyl struggled to keep his feet.  The blue stream gushed more furiously from the hand of the queen and Wyl watched in awe as the sun rapidly set!  As darkness fell, two moons rose rapidly in the east!  Within moments, the celestial dome became starry and moonlit, day had become night!  Wyl couldn't say whether the queen was using some dread magic to move the sun, or rotate the whole of Azeroth, or merely tuning into some massive planetary realignment she had foreknowledge of.  He just knew he was witnessing a display of magical power beyond anything he had ever seen before.
The earth was shaking so violently now that Wyl fell over.  He decided it was safer to stay on the ground while the air was filled with a deafening continuous rumble, as if mountains were colliding.


Then, the queen raised her other arm and more ectoplasmic streams formed.  This time they seemed to connect to the two moons that were quickly processing across the sky.  Wyl was in fear for his life, it felt as if Azeroth was breaking apart!  He lay flat and covered his head with his hands.  The crashing and banging got louder and louder until Wyl's ears hurt as he was tossed up and down by the bucking of the earth! He curled up in a ball, eyes screwed shut and waited for the final catastrophe.  Then his ears suddenly popped and all he could hear was a faint soprano singing.  The angelic harmonies grew steadily louder and higher.


He realised the ground was no longer shaking.  He sensed a warmth like the heat from a blazing log fire.  He opened his eyes to look at the queen.  She was still standing there.  Ectoplasmic streams seemed to be flowing into her arms from the two moons, which were now high and stationary, one above the other, in perfect vertical alignment with the zenith.  Tiny motes of flame were forming around the queen and radiating out in all directions.  Wyl could see the motes passing him.  They bathed the whole landscape in an eerie orange glow.  He focussed on the queen again and saw that she was almost skeletal, her flesh was peeling away to form the fiery motes.  Yet she stood firm, like an antennae directing the supernatural energy of the alignment.  The singing grew louder still, with an irresistible sweetness that caressed his heart and whispered to his soul.


Wyl looked around and suddenly realised that the glorious singing was coming from a great host of ghostly spirit-healers who hovered above the vast swathe of corpses, from one end of the battlefield to the other.  They were beaming down their life-giving essence upon the dead and reanimating them!  The fallen warriors of Azeroth were slowly resuscitating, as if arising from some deep drugged sleep.  A few were standing, but most were kneeling or sitting, looking dazed and confused.


Wyl quickly stood up and looked around.  Yes, it was true, the queen was using her unfathomable power to resurrect the entire army!  The king was risen already.  He stood, looking pained but resolute, watching the body of his beloved dissipate as she fed her healing essence into the great healing spell.  Wyl now sensed what the King had known; the army would be reborn, but the Queen would die.


The ectoplasmic streams suddenly sputtered out, the rebirthing complete.  The spirit-healers faded away, their warmth and song replaced by a chill wind.  The Queen was now nothing more than a pile of dry bones at the feet of her lover.  The King stood in silent contemplation for a few moments.  Then he turned to address the army from atop the small knoll, "Warriors of Azeroth and beyond, whatever we once were, we now stand united in our rebirth.  Queen Suzze is now the mother of us all.  We shall avenge her, and right the wrong that has scarred this landscape for these centuries past.  We shall crush the Arcanist and his foul army!  We shall tear down every stone of his vile citadel!  And we shall close for ever his portal to the nether regions!  Arise, spawn of Suzze!  Arise and prepare for battle!"
There was a great cheer and then a clamour as the army stirred and went about its preparations.


The King turned to Wyl, "Wait hereabouts, young mage.  I shall see to it that someone comes to give you your battle orders."
Then the King barked out commands to officers here and there and as a huddle they moved off amongst the army, issuing further commands as they went.


DARKNATURE


Wyl joined a knot of troops standing nearby, around the warm glow of a camp-fire they had just got going.  The warmth raised his spirits as he stared idly into the flames.  A chirpy goblin wandered among the throng, vending various performance enhancing goods.
"Hydra's Teeth, anybody?  Roll up, roll up!  Loadsa special offers, for today only!"
One or two bought things from him.  Then he moved towards Wyl.
"Hydra's Teeth!  Dragon's Doughnuts!  All at bargain prices, for one day only!"
He stepped up to Wyl, "Hello friend. What do you need?"
"Nothing thanks, I have plenty."
The goblin turned away and continued proclaiming his wares, "Undead's Underpants! Faerie Fire Faggots!  Come on! You know you need 'em!  These offers will never be repeated!"
"Hey, tauren!  You look like a mighty warrior to me, how about some Giant's Sweetbreads? They won't be goin' at these prices tomorrow!"
The huge warrior turned and said firmly, "I'm a dwarf."
Everyone about fell suddenly silent.
The goblin laughed, "Well friend, I have a good head for figures and I'd say you were at least ten feet tall."
The warrior bellowed furiously, "I! Am! A! Dwarf!  Yes, my mother was a dwarf!  Yes, my father was a dwarf!  Yes, they were both less than four feet tall!  No, I didn't have any tall uncles who visited from time to time, while dad was away!"
The goblin gulped nervously but then pitched right back, "Yes!  I see it now, the horned helmet threw me.  Warrior though, right?  Want some Giant's Sweetbreads?  My friend, this is your lucky day!  It just so happens they are buy-one-get-one-free to any dwarf over nine feet tall!"
The warrior resumed his firm but quieter voice, "No thanks.  Got somethin' better."
"Better?  These are the finest available.  There is no better!"
"Titan's Testicles. Plucked 'em m'self."
The goblin didn’t even blink, "You know my friend, I have one hell of a business proposition for you!  I'm sure you're gonna love it! Let's talk."
The rest of the exchange was lost to Wyl as the goblin lead the warrior away in conversation.


He stood warming himself by the fire, looking dreamily into the dancing flames.  Ah, radiant warmth.  He could almost smell his mother's cake, as he imagined her lifting it from the oven.  He recalled her words, the last time he tasted a slice, "You should look to a future beyond this cold valley.  Find a nice town somewhere and settle down; perhaps the great city of Ironforge, or even further afield."
He recalled the look of sharp pain in her eyes that belied her smile; the umbilical cut.
"Well, Mum, here I am, much further afield" he whispered to himself.


His reverie was broken by a nudge and a gruff voice, "'Ere young'un, wanna smoke?"
Wyl looked up at a dark night-elf druid, who was offering him a cigarette.
"Er, no thank you, I don't."
"Suit yerself," said the druid as he popped the fag into his own mouth and reached into the fire for a burning ember to light it with.  He puffed until he got the cigarette lit and threw the twig back on the fire.
"You should be ashamed," said a priest, from across the fire, "A healer, smoking!  I can see the shadow damage it does with each puff."
"Yeah, yeah, heard it all before mate," said the druid as he healed himself with a nonchalant wave, "I been a ghost in limbo for a hundred years, gaspin'!"
The priest tutted as he left.
"Don't forget to pray for me!" the druid called after him.
The priest gave no reply and soon disappeared amongst the throng.
The druid looked at Wyl through the corner of his eyes as he blew smoke at a tangent, "Best you don't smoke though, young'un.  You're no healer, so don't go livin' yer life as if yer were.  Us healers needs summink to steady us nerves.  It's no picnic, in the thick o' battle, tryin' to keep everyone around yer alive.  An' if we wipe, who gets the blame?  Healer, that's who.  No wonder so many o' us smokes.  An' tomorrow, well, we'll be fallin' like snowflakes into a volcano."
A dwarven warrior, with more brass in her voice than she had in her ornate breastplate, slipped up beside the druid and put her arm around him, "Hey, Darknature!  Still as miserable as ever.  Tomorrow will come soon enough, but the night is yet young, so, come cast again your sweet, sweet spell of lurve."
"See yer later," winked the druid to Wyl, as the couple went off giggling.


Wyl was left to console himself with the warmth of the fire.  He recalled the day he first journeyed through the mountain tunnel from Dun Morogh down to Loch Modan.  He'd never before seen countryside that wasn't covered in snow and ice, so he was fascinated by how green it all was.  Grasses grew everywhere.  He'd pulled a handful of grain from a roadside tuft and a tiny delicate bird had flown into the palm of his hand, to peck at the seed.  He could still feel the fluttering heartbeat of that fragile bird, even now.  For the first time in his life, he'd felt real warmth.


A troll warrior, who was shadow boxing as he walked, emerged from the gloom with an orc hunter.  A rogue standing across the fire, shouted to the hunter, "Hey Drix! Where you goin' with dat gun in your hand?
"I'm goin down to shoot dat magi.  You know dey caught 'im messin' 'round wid anudder demon.  An' dat ain't too cool!"
"Shoot him one more time for me, baby!"
The rogue then addressed the troll, "Jimi! Hey! Still champ' of the unarmed eh?"
The troll stood square before the rogue and punched the air, with amazing speed, either side of the rogue's head, while singing, "I stand up next to a mountain, chop it down with the edge of my hand. I pick up all the pieces and make an island, might even raise a little sand.  'Cause I'm a voodoo child, baby."
"There's no reason to get excited," the rogue he kindly spoke, "there are many here among us who feel that life is but a game.  But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate.  So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's gettin' late."
The troll stopped punching the air and laughed, "Well of course, I'm packing a little something extra," he grinned, pulling a huge two-handed axe from his pack, "Deep Cleavage; she'll feast tomorrow!"
The rogue laughed and tapped knuckles with them both.
“We hear Fisher McTavish reeled in a barrel o' grog.  Wanna come check it out?” said the hunter.
“Sure,” said the rogue.
As Wyl watched them head down to the beach, laughing and cavorting, he envied them their battle-tested friendships.


A couple of human paladins came by.  One pointed at Wyl and said, “Hey mage, I hear they're looking for gnomes to join an elite unit.”
Wyl looked up at the pair.
The other paladin said, “Yeah, their mission is to sow havoc amongst the enemy rear-guard.”
Wyl was about to explain he was waiting for special orders from the King, when they both guffawed loudly, “It's the Suicide Punt Squad!”
“Oh yeah, very funny,” said Wyl.
The paladins moved on, still laughing at their own joke.


ARCHBISHOP


Wyl looked across the fire towards the Black Citadel, which he couldn't quite place in the darkness, though distant lights burned in that direction.  He began to feel nervous.  Questions  tumbled through his mind, about why he was here and what might happen the following day.


As he wondered if this might be the last night of his life, he felt a tiny fluttering within, as if the stains of past sins were being gently cleansed from his soul.  He turned to look into the kindly gaze of the Archbishop.  He sensed an aura of forgiveness emanating from a big heart and saw there a genuine love for all souls, both good and bad.
“Peace be thine,” said the Archbishop softly, as he made the sign of the blessing.
“Thank you, your Holiness,” said Wyl.
The Archbishop looked to the horizon and Wyl turned to follow his gaze.
The Archbishop spoke quietly but clearly, “The Black Citadel.”
“Yes,” whispered Wyl.
“It's thousands of years old.  It has been the base of many a tyrant, even before the unholy Arcanist took up residence there, just over two hundred years ago.  History records only two  sorcerers who ever entered the Black Citadel and resisted its baleful influence, for a while at least.  They succumbed eventually.”
“Really?  They must have been very powerful.  Who were they?”
“My son, you are much better acquainted with them than I,” said the Archbishop as he patted Wyl's backpack.”
“Oh! You mean...”
“Yes. Their hearts were once filled with the divine light of love.”
The Archbishop placed his hands gently upon Wyl's shoulders and looked deep into his eyes.
“Our scryers have foretold of another.”
“Not Me?”
“Yes, you.”
“I can't... really, I can't.”
“Yes you can.  You have the heart for it.  You also have the knowledge and the power.”
“I don't! How could I defeat the unholy Arcanist alone?”
“My son, you will never be alone, you are deeply loved,” said the Archbishop with a gentle smile.
“But, what knowledge? What power?”
“Ah, yes.  The knowledge I shall impart to you now, and the power that knowledge brings.
The Black Citadel is actually built upon the site of an even older temple.  Yogg Sothoth is the name the ancient elves used for it.  It has many names in many tongues.  Its true name is unspeakable, not that any mortal should dare to utter it.  It means: The Gate to the Dreaming Place of the Great Old Ones.  It is older than Azeroth itself; a projection from an unholy dimension.
“It houses a portal, between the dimensions, that has lain dormant for aeons.  It is said that even the unholy Arcanist himself, shudders at what lies beyond that portal.  But, he draws on its fel-energy, to power his own portal to the Nether-regions.
“Once every thousand years, during the conjunction of space and time marked by the alignment, the dimension of the Great Old Ones touches ours.  They are as close as I am to you now and all around us.  We don't see Them, but, They, see us, in Their dark dreams. And the portal of the Great Old Ones can be opened.  They can be summoned forth into our dimension. That is the power you possess.”
“The tongues?”
“Yes. The tongues.  The tongues of the two sorcerers who divined the true nature of the elder portal.”
“But, I'm not sure what to do.”
“Fear not, young mage, the King will dispatch your orders soon enough.  I believe he is briefing a Draenei friend of yours, even as we speak.”
“Krendal!”
“Indeed.  You are far from alone, my son.  You will enter battle with friends, brothers, sisters and the holy light that shines within and without you.”
Wyl was happy and reassured that Krendal would be going with him to the citadel after all.
“Now,” continued the Archbishop, “I must tend the flock.  May the light guide you.”
The Archbishop and his attendants then walked up onto the knoll, from where he addressed the crowd around about.
“Brothers, sisters, we all know what tomorrow brings; a battle for civilization, a battle we thought we might fight for eternity and never win.  And yet, we have been given a second chance to finish it in mortal combat.  This is a rare gift indeed, in any lifetime.  Nevertheless, I know that some of you will be wondering: what's the point? We have been a long time dead and the world has moved on without us; we don't belong here in this time.”
There was some murmuring amongst the crowd.
The Archbishop carried on, “Well, the truth is, without another alignment and, indeed, without the great healer, Suzze, there isn't enough manna in heaven to resurrect all of us who will fall tomorrow.  So, to any of you who would wish those offering resurrection to pass you by, I offer you now, eternal salvation.  Come join with me, in the Guild of the Martyrs;  wear the Tabard of the Martyrs, as a sign that you wish to remain un-resurrected, should you fall in battle, and let the spirit-healers guide you through limbo, to your seat of honour, at the Everlasting Feast of the Martyrs.”
A trickle of people came forward and took a blessing from the Archbishop and a tabard from the attendants.  More soon followed.
Then Wyl heard a familiar voice behind him say, “Hello, friend.”
Wyl spun around to see the big Draenei grinning down at him.
They embraced and patted each other on the back.
“So,” Wyl said, “you fulfil your destiny after all!”
“And you too, perhaps?”
“So it would seem.”
“I have our orders from the King.”
“Indeed.  The Archbishop has explained something of our part.”
“Well, I haven't eaten for a hundred years.  Are you hungry?”
“Me hungry?  Silly question!” Wyl laughed, “I hear there's a party on the beach; let's give that a try.”
“Just lead me to it!” laughed Krendal.


BATTLE


The new dawn arrived slowly.  The deep purple sky, with its panoply of twinkling stars, turned violet, as the first morning rays stretched from beyond the horizon to bestow their warmth.  As the rim of the sun itself appeared, the King shouted his orders, which were spread throughout the entire host by each unit commander in turn. As the sun rose, the army appeared from the gloom, in well organized lines and groups.  The front rank then responded in unison to the first order; they turned their polished shields on-mass, to reflect the first rays of the sun at the Black Citadel.
The King held his sword high and shouted, “For the Light!”
The shout was repeated as a mighty roar by the assembled host.  Then all was suddenly quiet again, save for the fluttering of banners and the occasional snorting stallion.
“Onward!” shouted the King, as he spurred his war mammoth forward.
The kettle-drums struck up the beat of the march and the vast army moved slowly forward in formation.


Wyl watched the steady progress of the host for a few moments, until he heard a familiar voice calling to him from behind.  He turned to see three Draenei approaching.
“Good morning, Wyl,” said Krendal.
“Let's hope so,” Wyl replied.
“Indeed.  Please welcome Grend the paladin and Psiglo the healer, they will be joining our party.”
“Greetings,” said Wyl as the two Draenei gave their traditional formal salute.
“So, let's collect our other party member and then get in position,” said Krendal as he mounted-up.
Once they were all mounted, Krendal led the way down the sandy slope and onto the eastern flank of the marching army, where they galloped through a crowd of toiling sappers and their siege engines, until Krendal pulled up at a supply depot that was busy with frantic activity.
A ruddy-faced, grey-bearded dwarf waved at Krendal and shouted, “Be with you in a mo' mate!”
Wyl and the three Draenei dismounted and stood waiting while the dwarf barked orders at a group of engineers.  After a minute or two, the dwarf walked over to Wyl and looked him up and down.
“So, you must be the secret weapon then!”
Wyl looked nonplussed.
The dwarf slapped Wyl on the back and laughed, “Cheer up lad, it'll be free beer for life if we pull this off!”
Nodding in the direction of the three Draenei, he continued with a broad grin, “Let's show these Outlanders what the men of Ironforge are made of.  They call me Boomer Brunner, an' I is pleased to make your acquaintance.”
“Thanks, I'm Wyl.  Pleased to meet you too.”
“Well, then, let's get busy while our powder is dry!” said Boomer as he mounted up.
Once they were all mounted, Boomer led the way out of the depot.  The clamour of the army was soon far behind them as they headed into the hills to the east of the citadel.
Not long into the hills they were greeted by another dwarf, who suddenly appeared from behind a large boulder, brandishing a heavy blunderbuss.
“Hey Boomer!”
“Hey mate!  How's it going?”
“We got the mine open, couple o' sticks did it.  The lads went in to pave the way, just follow the  torches.”
“That's great!”
Before much longer, they were at the mine entrance, an unnatural cave in the hillside.  Fragments of the boulders that had sealed the mine were scattered about the entrance. Another sentry greeted Boomer then vanished once again amongst the rubble.  They dismounted and entered.  Flaming torches marked their way as they walked carefully into the gloom.  To their annoyance, the three Draenei had to stoop awkwardly.  Boomer chuckled and led on.  Here and there, they passed over the fresh corpses of giant cave bats.
“Keep your eyes peeled, the lads might miss some...”
Even before he had finished his sentence, Boomer was interrupted by  the bright flash and loud clang of Grend's Hammer of Justice hitting a startled bat on the head.
“Awesome,” growled the paladin.
Excitement over, they trod on in the flickering gloom.  The tunnel wound on and down, deeper and deeper into the hillside.
They had been stumbling after the dwarf for about another twenty minutes, when he whispered loudly, “Halt!”
They all froze in mid-stride.


A few yards ahead, a torch spluttered alight to reveal a pair of steely eyes and a toothless grimace.  Grend stepped up beside the dwarf and raised his massive two-handed hammer.
“Steady lad,” laughed Boomer, “It's McTavish.  For better or worse, he's on our side.”
“Ach, Boomer, yer bloody layabout, what took yer so long?” joked McTavish.
“Who'd rush to see thee ugly mush!”
“He he, lotsa lassies would,” winked McTavish.
“Well, are we all primed?”
“Aye, just about, here's the master fuse,” said McTavish as he waved the torch to his right to reveal the coiled end of a fuse on the rough rock floor.
Just then two more dwarves appeared behind McTavish, who turned to address them, “All done?”
“All done,” said the one with the fiery red beard.
“Aye, all done,” said the other one, who looked identical with an identical fiery red beard.
McTavish turned back to Boomer, “We're all done.”
Boomer turned to Grend, “We're all done,” he said.
Grend turned to Krendal.
“Yeah,” said Krendal before Grend could speak, “I get it, we're all done.”
Grend chuckled, “Awesome.”
“I'll do the honours,” said McTavish.
“Everyone else back up the tunnel a bit,” ushered Boomer, “It's gonna be loud!”
They stumbled back in the gloom, until they rounded the next bend.  Boomer and the two fiery bearded dwarves sat in a line with their backs to the wall, put their fingers in their ears and screwed their eyes tight-shut.  The three Dranei looked at them and then at each other before they also sat in a line against the wall opposite, with their fingers in their ears and their eyes tight-shut.
Oh what a picture, thought Wyl.
He sat down between the line of Dranei on the one side and dwarves on the other, put his fingers in his ears and screwed tight-shut his eyes. Within a moment, there was a loud boom and the cave shook as dust and small pebbles rained down on them.  A moment later, a choking, sooty cloud passed around the bend in the tunnel and over them.  Wyl held his breath as the stench of burnt gunpowder filled his nostrils, but a strong breeze sprang up and the air soon cleared.
“Let's go!” shouted Boomer.
They all sprang to their feet and dusted themselves off.  Krendal and Grend, mighty sword and hammer drawn, strode side by side, closely followed by Psiglo, then the dwarves and finally Wyl.  They rounded the bend to see a warm light at the end of the tunnel.  As they strode in formation, they could eventually make out the silhouette of McTavish back-lit within the jagged circular hole the dynamite had wrought.  He was looking out onto the scene beyond the blast-hole; all Wyl could make of it were seething clouds that appeared lit by some great raging fire. They continued on but the floor was strewn with larger rubble that made the going more difficult and slower.  The frequent curses in various dialects were testimony to the fact that Wyl wasn't the only one stubbing toes and turning ankles.  They were close to McTavish now and could hear  a great strange sounding wind.  A little further on, Wyl thought the clouds had resolved into a swirling flock of birds or perhaps insects and the strange wind into the whoosh of their motion through the air and the beat of millions of tiny wings.
McTavish half-turned towards them and pointed down, shouting, “There's a ledge!”
Suddenly, a swift shadow of wing and claw flashed past the hole and took McTavish with it.
“McTavish!” shouted Boomer with a cry that began as reprimand and ended in grief.
Psiglo, strode forward a few paces, “We need to recce the ledge. Krendal, you get out there and take a look.  Mage, freeze him to the ledge, we don't want to lose another.”
The Draenei healer dropped a clutch of totems as Krendal stepped out.  Wyl cast Frost at his feet while Grend stood just behind Krendal with hammer raised.
“Incoming!” shouted Krendal.
A swift clawed creature flew into him but he batted it towards Grend with his shield, who smashed it flat into the cave floor with a single thunderous blow.  Krendal looked around and had to direct  two more winged attackers beneath Grend's mighty hammer-blows before the Frost melted and he stepped back into the tunnel.
“It's a huge cylindrical cave stretching up and down into the mists. There is a strange pulsating portal of fire below and a portal of green fel fire above.  There is a great swarm of those winged horrors circling between the two portals.  As McTavish said, there is a ledge, spiralling around the cave wall, but out there we would be at the mercy of the winged horrors.  It's not obvious where it leads down to, but a few hundred yards up there is some sort of pillared temple carved into the rock-face.”
“That should be close enough.” said Wyl, “But I will need time to invoke the spell.”
“Aye lad, what spell would that be then?” said Boomer.
“The spell to close the nether portal, I think,” Wyl replied.
“Yer think? Dun yer ken why we 'ere lad?”
Wyl pulled the Ouroboros of Benzol and the jar containing the wriggling tongues from his backpack.
“It's slowly dawning on me.  It's something to do with these and the portals.  I don't know if anyone is sure this will work, but there's a chance we can prevent Zarqoma calling through his demonic allies, perhaps seal the portal forever and end his terrible reign.”
“Ooer, successful or not it doesnay sound like the sorta fight we'll all walk away from.”
Krendal lay one hand on Wyl's shoulder, “We three Draenei have sworn to help you accomplish your mission, no matter what it costs us, although we'll try to get us all out of here alive if we can.”
Krendal turned to Boomer, “You and your boys have done your bit, so don't feel you have to get into this fight.  At least one of you should report back whether we succeed or not.”
“Och, the King'll figure it out fer 'imself.  We're in!”
“Awesome.” said Grend, raising his hammer in salute.
“Okay,” said Psiglo, “But how do we buy enough time for the spell?  How much time do you need?”
"Sorry," said Wyl, "I really have no idea."
"Ok, first things first," said Psiglo, "Let's figure out how we get up to the temple, we may see better from up there."
"I don't fancy our chances out on this ledge," said Krendal, "if the swarm decends I won't be able to shield us all."
"We need a distraction," said Boomer, "Got any dynamite left lads?"
"No dynamite," said the first twin.
"But we do have a keg o' gunpowder each," grinned the second twin.
"Now that's my kinda distraction!" bellowed Boomer.
The twins laughed loudly, if a little nervously.
"Right lads, build a dwarven fishing pole.  Here, use this rope an’ get sharp!"


Wyl and the Draenei watched as the twins each tied one end of a long rope to their keg and then tied the other ends to a massive boulder amongst the rubble.  Boomer helped them position the kegs in the blast hole and afix fuses.


Boomer turned to Wyl and the Draenei, "Righto, the twins'll push the kegs down the ledge and we'll hope they pull a good catch while we make a dash up to the temple."
"Awesome," said Grend as he raised his hammer in salute.
"Right, let's do it!" shouted Krendal, "Grend, you behind me, then Wyl, then Boomer, then Psiglo in the rear."
"Good luck laddies," Boomer said to the twins, "Let the king know we gave it our best shot."
The twins stood ready to kick the kegs out onto the ledge as Boomer lit the fuses.
"Ready, steady, go!" shouted Boomer.
The twins kicked the kegs through the blast hole.  One tumbled over the edge and fell out of site while the other rumbled down the rocky ledge.  The swirling swarm reacted immediately as one and the greater mass of it spiralled down towards the falling kegs.
"Go! Go! Go!" shouted Krendal, "Mind the rope!"
They leapt out onto the ledge in the designated order.  Psiglo dropped a couple of totems as distractions of his own and they all ran pell mell up the rough path towards the temple columns.
The distraction worked well.  For the first half of the steep hundred yard dash they were untroubled by the swarm and only a couple of stragglers attempted to intercept them.  The Krendal and Grend tag team dealt with them with ruthless efficiency.  Wyl was just beginning to feel breathless when the rough path became a broader marble staircase and the going got easier.  Then he heard a boom from below which gave him an extra spurt of adrenaline and helped him catch up with Grend, who had been leaving him behind.  A second boom followed a few seconds later.  No one stopped to look back.


Then the chamber rocked again to an even greater booming, the sound of a thunderous deep voice, rough with gravel the size of boulders, "Who calls the Great Old Ones from their eternal dreaming?"


"Oh bugger," puffed Boomer without breaking stride, "We woke somebody up."


"Never mind that! We're in for a warm reception!" Krendal shouted urgently, gesturing towards a crowd of guards forming up in the temple entrance.


As they rushed up the marble staircase, two heavily armoured, spear brandishing Guardians of Zarqoma barred their way.  Krendal unleashed his battle cry and crashed shield first straight through them, splintering both spear shafts.  Before the guards could respond Krendal smashed one on top of the head with the hilt of his broadsword and Grend stunned the other with his Hammer of Justice then finished him with a hammer blow to the head.


Four more guards rushed up but the first ran onto Krendal's Shield Smash and was knocked clean-out.  Krendal Taunted the other three, who formed a semicircle around him and all simultaneously thrust their spears.  Krendal dodged inside the leftmost spear while sweeping away to the right the thrusts of the other two with his sword.  Grend flew through the air with his hammer held high behind his head and smashed it through the skull of the guard on the right.  Krendal rammed his sword back left into the throat of the guard on that side.  Grend swung his hammer in a massive jaw breaking uppercut that flung the last guard backwards several yards.


They all ran between the pillars and into the temple.


A large slowly spinning red crystal, fizzing with arcane energies was suspended in mid air above a central altar, ringed by Acolytes of Zarqoma who were all focusing their arcane emanations towards the crystal in some diabolical ritual.


Grend immediately cast Consecration, covering the floor of the chamber in glowing runes of holy light.  The Acolytes all shuddered and wailed as they broke painfully from their ritual.


The Arch Acolyte pointed a wizened finger and cried balefully, “Cast out the desecrators!”
“Awesome!”, shouted Grend with relish as he dropped Hammer of Justice onto the Arch Acolyte's head and smashed him down with a mighty hammer blow.


The Acolytes had gathered their wits and several were conjuring their necromantic familiars.


Boomer slapped Wyl on the back, “Better be about yer business me lad, while we keep this lot busy!”


“What the hell am I supposed to do?”, he cried in frustrated anger.
“Buggered if I know laddie, but do summin quick!”


Meanwhile, the Acolytes had conjured their phalanx of Bone Warriors.  Krendal taunted them and they began to surround him but Boomer ran up between Krendal and Grend.
“Duck! And watch out for splinters!”, he shouted as he unleashed his blunderbuss into the throng of Bone Warriors.  Krendal dived left and Grend dived right, hitting the ground just as the bone shrapnel exploded everywhere.  For a few moments friend and foe alike were blinded by the sulphurus smoke cloud. But when it cleared, only the the front rank of the Bone Warriors had taken the full force of the blast; the rest began charging.


Krendal leapt to his feet with a furious battle-cry and decapitated the first Bone Warrior with a quick swing of his sword while bashing another with his shield. Grend flew through the air to deliver another mighty hammer smash that splintered more bones as Boomer blasted away at the Acolytes with his pistols.  The main cohort of Bone Warriors smashed into Krendal and Grend, raining down many more blows than the heroic Dranei could fend or block.  Psiglo cast Earth-Shield on Krendal and a spinning ball of rock began rapidly orbiting the mighty tank, absorbing blow after blow from the Bone Warriors.  Psiglo dropped a Healing-Stream totem that pulsed life back into his allies, gently healing wounds and reinvigorating tired muscles.


Wyl was about to assist by raining down fire on the Bone Warriors when he noticed a sudden increase in brightness of the acrid green glow coming from behind him.  He spun around to see the sorcerer Zarqoma floating down on demon wings of fel flame and alighting at the top of the marble staircase.  He was flanked by two demons of fire and brimstone who turned the marble to lava where they stepped.


Zarqoma laughed with mighty disdain, "Pathetic fool!  Do you really think you can unravel the mystery of the curse?  What do you know of death and dying, much less of the undying?  Perhaps I should teach you of these things?  Yes, that would be a fitting punishment indeed, to have you realise just how lowly you are, to have the knowledge, but not the power to use it.  But how?  It would take a whole other lifetime, much less privileged, for you to truly understand the meaning of these things."


Wyl began casting, but Zarqoma silenced and debilitated him with a brief mumbled whisper.


Zarqoma laughed again, "Aha! I have it.  You will learn of all these things and you will despair with the knowing.


Wyl could see Zarqoma conjuring, but he was powerless to break free.  His felt his life drip away slowly, as if Zarqoma was needlessly spinning it out for his own amusement.  Wyl's last thoughts were concerns for his comrades in the temple, the army relying on him, the king, Eweline, his family, his lost love. There was no pain, only a mounting regret.


When death came, it was not quite like all his previous deaths.  True, he was suddenly wrenched from the scene of his demise and he was a ghost in an unfamiliar graveyard.  But there was no spirit healer to offer resurrection.  There was no indication of where his corpse lie.  He was a lost spirit in a strange limbo.


Wyl wandered like this for an interminable time that seemed like years or maybe eons.  The wandering was all he came to know.  All of his past lives were expunged from his memory.  Occasionally his wanderings might happen upon a grey vista or tumbled ruin that looked momentarily familiar, but these feelings of deja vu quickly passed.


Until, one day, he found himself in an oddly familiar graveyard, where he became engulfed in a cloud of thick smoke.  Eventually, the smoke cleared to reveal a sagged and wrinkled old woman.  She was shaking as if with intense pain; skin cracked like a dried up riverbed; body crisscrossed by deep scars weeping dark, ashen puss; sunken, hollowed, bloodshot eyes filled with torment and anguish. She breathed a long, rattling, putrid breath, that stung Wyl's eyes and made him gag.


It slowly dawned on Wyl that he had a form that was no longer ghostly and that the world had colour.
The old hag cackled, "Welcome into the service of the Dark Lady."
Though Wyl's memories were still fogged, he understood straight away that the old hag had used necromantic arts to raise him into the cult of the undead.
"So recruit, you shall train as a warlock, for no matter what your previous earthly existence entailed, I sense you might have some magical ability.  Go down into the sepulchre and seek out the warlock trainer to begin your service of the Dark Lady.  No doubt the trainer will reward you with some rags better fitting than those mould ridden tatters that barely cover your ancient bones."


And so Wyl began a new cycle of lives, among the Undead.


[leveling and becoming an affliction lock]


Wyl stood stock still, looking down at his skeletal fingers and the rings that shone dully from them, in particular, the faintly fluorescent Band of Burning Servitude, while Subjugator Shi'hraz, the arch-demon in command of the Burning Legion forces in the region, ranted for over an hour.  She walked round and round the room, looking straight through Wyl whenever she looked in his direction, her six blue arms flailing in mock combat, the cold blue flames burning fiercely in her empty eye-sockets.  As usual, it was all about some minor defeat she had recently suffered in the field.  He'd heard it too many times before to boil-up inside any more.  He showed no emotion and made no comment as she railed against incompetent generals, even when she belittled his own past achievements.
At last she drew breath and continued more calmly.
“I am sure your campaign successes have brought some little repute in the provinces.  But, I have much grander dreams warlock, so what of those?”
“My lady, I have completed many quests in your service, and at last, the final task is accomplished.”
“Final task?” she laughed, derisively, “Nay.  For those that truly serve, there are further tasks to complete on each and every day.  Great honour and great rewards await the most dedicated servants.”
She handed Wyl a bundle of heavy parchment sheaves entitled 'Servant of the Ring'.  Wyl stuffed them into his quest log.
“Nonetheless, my lady, I have reached the end of the current chain.”
“So, what reward are you expecting?  A powerful trinket perhaps?”
She opened her palm to reveal a tiny golden star: An Ounce of Gratitude – Use: reflects one hundred percent of healing you receive to all party or raid members.
She snapped her hand shut and spun on her heels, “Keep trying warlock and you may earn it one day.”
Her final words fluttered like bats between the high rafters as she vanished into the war-room.


Wyl marched out of the keep and stood atop the snow covered stone steps of the main gate, between the two skeletal guards.  The teeth of the guards chattered as they tried in vain to draw comfort from the unlit brazier.
Wyl looked into the distance mumbling to himself, “How I tire of this land of the dancing dead.”
“Er?” said the guards.
Wyl spoke up, “It never seems to get any warmer, does it?  How I miss my flesh.”
The guards grunted assent.
Wyl continued, “We've already cut down every tree, so there is nothing to warm our hearths now.  But look yonder, that's the corpse of the king of the treants, the last of his kind.  I see the hangman found a use for him.”
“Bring an axe from the blacksmith, on my order!” Wyl barked at the guard nearest.
“Yes, my Lord,” said the guard as he scurried off.
“This once was a warm land, a long time ago.”
“Yes, my lord,” replied the remaining guard.
“You local?”
“No, my lord.  I think I grew up on a farm in Westfall.”
“Ah, I remember it well; gentle hills and fields of golden wheat.”
“Memories of that former life are so faded now.”
“Do you recall being raised from the dead to this sham existence?”
“Aye, m'lord. The necromancer Muzarak raised my bones from the dust of the Eastern Plaguelands.  I assume I had died there but whether plague or blade did for me I do not recall.”
“Mmm, my former life and death are dim shadows too.”
The other guard returned with a woodsman's axe.
“Good man,” said Wyl, “I'll stand your watch while you two go and cut the bough from the treant and chop logs for the brazier.”
“Yes, my lord!” they said enthusiastically.
As Wyl watched them hurry down the hill, he sensed the presence of another.  He surreptitiously slipped a vial of Cat's Eye Elixir from his pouch and took a sip.  A rogue un-stealthed a few yards away, treading carefully up the steps.
“Welcome, assassin,” Wyl said quietly.
The rogue stopped in her tracks.
“If it is I your blade hungers for, then let’s go at it; if it's the Subjugator, then she is in the keep, alone, in her war-room.”
She put her hand to her masked lips and blew Wyl a silent, theatrical kiss.   Then, she turned and tiptoed on through the gate-arch.  Wyl thought she looked familiar, something about the deep, dark eyes and the lithe grace, but the red bandanna face-mask made it difficult to place her.


As the rogue vanished into the keep, the sound of huffing and puffing drew his attention to the guards lugging the bough of the hanging-tree up the stone steps.  They lay the gnarled old bough by the brazier and took a short breather.  Then the beefier guard began chopping the bough into rough logs.  Wyl thought he heard a faint commotion within the keep, but the guards seemed not to notice.  The Band of Burning Servitude suddenly felt loose and Wyl looked down to see it had stopped glowing. The beefy guard soon had a small pile of logs and the other guard laid them in the brazier as he grinned, “There's enough wood in this bough to keep us warm for a week!”
The guard with the axe stopped chopping to mop his brow, “You should try choppin' it mate, it's warmed me up good 'n' proper.”
“Aye mate, that'll do for now, I'll chop some more later.”
Turning to Wyl, the guard said, “With your permission, my lord, I'll go collect some dry grass for kindling.”
“No need,” replied Wyl, “I have something.”
Wyl took out his quest log and flipped through the heavy parchments to the 'Servant of the Ring'.  He pulled the bundle from his quest log and handed it to the guard.
Wyl stood and watched as the guard made the quest parchments into faggots and then built-up the firewood around them.  Then Wyl pulled the Band of Burning Servitude from his finger and threaded it onto one of the dry finger-like twigs that stuck out of the bough.
“Behold!  The King of the Treants doth serve her now.”
The guards looked askance.
“Just my private joke,” said Wyl with a wink.
He cast a flame spell and the parchment caught fire immediately.
Within minutes they could feel the radiant warmth as the wood burned fiercely.
A little later, the fire settled and a shower of sparks billowed into the sky.  Wyl watched the embers dance their way to freedom.
Wyl handed out Nethergarde Ale to appreciative noises from the two guards, “A toast: may the jolly hangman hang us well!”

Unbridled Passion – her face swam before him – he recalled the trinket she pressed to his palm – frees all chains – constraints – all conscience – ANNiHILATE!




He lay naked on his back, staring up into the bright grey of the gently falling rain, blinking frequently as the raindrops fell into his eyes.  First, he sensed a shadow, then her beautiful face came into view.  She smiled and he smiled back.  He tried to form a word, but could only gurgle like a newborn child.


The skin on her face rapidly aged and cracked until it looked like a riverbed to which the rains would never return, even as she wept.  He disintegrated to dust under her sorrowful gaze.  The wind swirled around and formed his dry remains into a pile.  A laughing hyena cocked its leg and urinated onto the pile.  A familiar looking giant knelt and scooped him into a huge palm, then kneaded him back into his manly shape before putting him into the forge.  But it was too hot and he cracked to become merely dust once again.  Oh what a thirst he had.


[DIES AS UNDEAD, in Grimshire can only see folk here coz near corpse, goes to look at corpse but refuses to rez]


(near Ironford?)


He spent yet another evening in the Scarlet Raven Tavern.  And once again, he drank and drank and drank.  From somewhere beyond the drunken haze, a soft female voice spoke, “Would you mind if I drank some of your leftover wine.”
For a moment he thought he recognised the voice and a tiny glimmer of hope leapt in his chest.  But then he remembered standing amongst the runed pillars of Zul'Farrak with the white sands of the Tanaris desert stinging his face.  He remembered the pile of bones by the altar there and the skeletal finger that wore the ring he had given her.  He remembered the revenge he had exacted from the denizens of that place.  Blood drinkers!  He had given them blood; blood enough to drown in. Yet even as he relived these gruesome memories they seemed to belong to someone else.  He tried to look up, but his head fell back onto his arms and his eyelids felt like lead.
She spoke again, “Why do you hang about in Grimshire?  It's such a dreary place.”
He tried to grunt but even that was beyond him.
“Surely, a powerful mage like you can do better than this?”
He thought about trying to answer, but the innkeeper said, “Who are you talking to miss?”
“Why, I'm talking to the mage sitting... he's gone!”
“Aye miss, that'll be the ghost.  The ghost of Wyl of Ironforge, some say.”
“Oh!”


Ironforge.  The name rattled around inside his skull.  He stood beside the huge anvil within the Great Forge.  Once the scene of bustling industry, where the swords and armour of mighty Ironforge had been hammered noisily into shape, it was all silent now, except for the forlorn wind that moaned incessantly.  The great vat was cold and empty of the bubbling, molten metal, that had bequeathed the city its name.  A ruined city, deserted now, but for the timid ghosts that whispered fables of a failed race.


“Argh! To whom do these drunken dreams that haunt me belong?”
He sought comfort in the ice and snow.  After an interminable wandering, he found himself looking north from atop high Frostblade Peak. Standing on the very edge of the precipice, with the ancient altar-stone behind him, he looked down to the distant ice-covered rocks far, far below.  He leant slowly forward and then fell and fell, his fluttering cloak and the rushing air the only sounds. He laughed at the world, for at last he felt free of it; yet the world still pulled him back.  After a few brief moments of exhilaration, the world caught him gently in crisp fresh snow.  He lay face down for a moment, trying to savour the memory of cool snow-melt on his skin, but the sensations eluded him.  Then he arose and stood looking north again, where pale green aurora played across the horizon.  He thought for a moment that it was a trick of the light, but no, he was sure he could see a spirit-healer flying towards him.  Within moments, the graceful apparition hovered before him on the slow, graceful beat of her spirit wings.


Wyl looked into her beautiful forgiving eyes, “I seek no resurrection,” he said quietly.
The spirit healer reached out and clasped Wyl softly to her breast.  Without another word the pair ascended high above the trees.  Wyl did not resist; he felt a great comforting of the heart in that divine embrace.  The grey earth sped by beneath them, league upon league, day upon day and night upon night, until at last the spirit healer descended and laid Wyl tenderly upon the earth.


As the spirit healer released Wyl from her soothing embrace, his soul sickness left him too and memories of his former life returned with a jolt.
He looked into the face of the graceful spirit healer, “Suzze!”
He suddenly saw where he was, in the citadel graveyard. He stood as a shadowy ghost, bathed in the glowing light of the spirit-healer, the terrible cold of death permeating every fibre of his being. Yet the pain was sweetened by the deep yearning for eternal peace. He knew he could choose now, to cease forever the torment of his corporeal existence. The spirit-healer hovered silently above him, awaiting patiently the answer to her unspoken question; life or afterlife?  All his past lives in this sphere called to him, as did the lives yet to be. But how shallow all his devious schemes and worldly aspirations seemed in that moment too. But something else also called to him, some vestige of his spirit that cried out for rebirth, some fervent conviction that his time here was not yet run.  There were people... who needed him.  He fought himself within himself; improbable hope against predictable disappointment.
Slowly, he stretched his arms out to the graceful spirit floating above him, as the bittersweet longing forced an anguished cry from his ghostly lips, "Resurrection!"


His body was racked with terrible agonies as the spirit healer channelled her living essence into him. He sensed the solidity of his body return as he dropped to his knees gasping. As the hurting waned, to become the more bearable aching of resurrection sickness, he smelled the earth and the grass and felt the lesser chill of a natural wind.


[Suzze rez’s as Mage not Warlock?  Or maybe is Warlock but with mage memories - but how can he be on the side of the Alliance?  Make it clear that the war on Zarqoma is both factions!]

Drifted silently down like golden snow.  He held out his hands and one settled gently onto his palm.  It looked beautiful, like a tiny delicate crystal dandelion seed.
The Arcanist spoke slowly and ominously, “Weep for them mage, these seeds of the souls of children as yet unborn, your future lives that shall never be.”
As Wyl watched, the seed melted to nothing.
“He's killing our future.”


Arcanist casts Fear – Wyl runs around as his life dwindles – but the curse ends – he reaches for the tongues – Arcanist casts Cradle to Grave


An instinctual, ancestral terror awoke within him; he knew it and feared it and hated it; as did every sentient being in existence.  A pan-dimensional evil so malefic, that a single universe could not contain it. The Devourer of Souls, The Death of Deaths, The Final Assimilation.  Its amorphous flesh boiled, hissed and erupted continuously, in an obscene chaos of tongues: slimy tongues, barbed tongues, sharp tongues, stinging tongues, forked tongues, writhing tongues, ululating tongues, lashing tongues, glutinous tongues, foetid tongues, poison tongues.  It tore, crushed, digested and absorbed, seeming impervious to the constant barrage of blows, curses and spells, that the Arcanist and his demon cohort rained down upon it.  It distorted the space within its radius of malevolence, as if it were consuming the very fabric of the cosmos. The more they hurled at it, the more it grew and festered; the faster the demons poured in through the nether-portal, the faster they were devoured.  The smoke-filled air was thick with the flashes and radiances of every school of destructive magic, from elemental to arcane, from nature to shadow, but nothing made any impression on the Great Old One, which just slithered inexorably toward the nether-portal, until it engulfed the very portal itself and consumed it, as if it were merely physical.










Boomer stooped to pick up a spluttering torch from the tunnel floor, “Careless of the lads to drop this here... ugh!” he said in alarm, as he dropped the torch, “It's covered in slime.  Look lively, something's afoot!” he continued as he cocked his rifle.
Krendal stepped forward and picked up the torch, “Cover me.”
“Aye mate,” said Boomer.
, then followed a few steps behind Krendal as the warrior edged into the gloom ahead.


Psiglo dropped a clutch of totems and Wyl immediately felt his manna and spell power boosted.
Krendal got about twenty yards further then stopped, “There's a shaft,” he shouted back, “It goes up and down.”
Wyl, Psiglo and Boomer joined Grend and Krendal.
Wyl looked up, following the gaze of the dwarf.  About thirty feet above them a heavy wrought iron gate capped the top of the shaft; beyond it, a dark-red portal flickered balefully.
“Aye, that's it,” Boomer said, “That's the portal, beneath the central tower of the citadel.”
“So this shaft must be the means by which the Arcanist channels the fel-energy to the portal,” said Krendal.
“I reckon,” said Boomer.
“Where is the advance party?” asked Grend.
They all looked down into the pit of unfathomable darkness.
“Och, no, not ma laddies,” groaned Boomer.
Wyl closed his eyes and strained his magi senses to explore the darkness.
“There is something big down there,” he whispered, “And whatever it is, the Arcanist clearly felt the need to keep it trapped in here.”
Boomer kept on mumbling, “Ma boys... ma boys... ma boys.”
The flickering torch flame sparkled on the tears in the dwarf's eyes.
“Your sons?” asked Wyl.
“Aye,” said the dwarf, sadly.
Boomer unhitched his backpack and started emptying the contents on the ground.  He stood up when he found the heavy rope and tools he was looking for.
“You fellows go up and complete the mission.  I'm going down.”
“But...” began Krendal.
“You won't change ma mind so don't try,” said the dwarf firmly.
As Boomer began to hammer a metal stake into the cave floor, Psiglo stepped forward and took the hammer.
“Here, let me,” he said.
After four mighty blows from the big Draenei, the stake was firmly embedded.
Boomer tied the rope and tossed the loose end into the pit.
Then he turned to Wyl, “You better hurry, the sappers will have breached the walls by now and the Arcanist will soon be calling up his demon reinforcements through the portal.  You can't let that happen.”
Boomer wrapped more rope around his shoulders and neck, shoved the hammer and more stakes into his belt and took hold of the dangling rope.
“Best o' luck to you all,” he said as he stepped back and lowered himself into the darkness, while the others watched.


Wyl vs Zarqoma






EPILOGUE


Wyl wandered aimlessly around the courtyard, where the goblins, always quick to spot a business opportunity, had already set out their stalls.  Then he noticed the rogue stood by the ornate central fountain.  He admired her black-leather feminine silhouette for a few moments before  he walked up behind her and said hello.
As she turned, he noticed tiny tears in the corners of her eyes.
“What's the matter?” he said, as quietly as he could above the market hubbub.
“Don't worry about me,” she shrugged, “I'll cope;  I always do.”









Truly Naked Ball


Meet by fountain.


"Are you really sure you want to take a thief to the ball?"
"Well, I was kinda hoping you would steal my heart."


They approached the door to the great hall, where waiters stood with trays of drinks.  One of the waiters, clearly some gnomish robotic device, clanked and buzzed as he addressed them cheerily, "Good evening, one and all.  His majesty humbly requests that you accept this free drink upon entry, to the Truly Naked Ball."
"Aha!" said Wyl, "I finally get to see your face!"
"Well, just make sure you keep your gaze up at that level!" said the rogue, though the twinkle in her dark eyes hinted that she may not mean it.  They each took a shot glass from the tray and knocked them back in one.  There was a brief hissing as they became obscured in a cloud of violet vapour.  Wyl watched intently for the face of the rogue to appear as the vapour gradually dissipated.  But as the cloud evaporated, they both burst into laughter; they had both been transformed into skeletons, stripped of all flesh except their eyeballs.
"Darn it! I've been cheated!" Wyl laughed.
"My secret is safe," laughed the rogue.
"I must say though, you have wonderful bone structure," said Wyl, as he took the rogue by the hand and escorted her, giggling, into the Great Hall.
They stopped at the top of the steps to look down upon the revellers already inside; they were all skeletons, all truly naked.  Laughing, they skipped down the staircase and joined the throng.  The chamber was awash with a wonderful warming light and they felt buoyed amongst the glittering, magical chandeliers, that floated like soap bubbles, beneath a soft rain of twinkling stardust.  Happily, they danced together, and, gazing deep into each others eyes, the crowd became just a hazy backdrop.
Wyl held her close and whispered breathlessly, “That roguish hardness is gone from your eyes tonight; perhaps it's the light.”
She whispered back softly, “Perhaps it's the company; I feel... aglow.”
“Oh you are.  Me too; this skeleton grin shows exactly how I feel.”
“Can skeletons kiss?”
Wyl held her tight and lowered his mouth to hers, but their teeth grated on each other's and they burst into laughter.
“Perhaps it's for the best,” she whispered, “otherworldly adventurers shouldn't go falling in love.”
“Not even just for one night?”
“We can dance the dance.”
“Then dear lady, let's dance until our hearts are full.”
“Yes let's,” she giggled.
They spun majestically across the floor, stirring a swirling fractal of graceful whorls within the cloud of sparkling dust, and mingled with the radiant throng of dancing bones and grinning skulls.




Tongues cursing each other in jar




"I want you to use all of that stone over there to build a shrine to Queen Suzze."
"Och! That will be a very expensive job.  Shall we discuss payment, your majesty?"
"Certainly goblin.  In exchange for a beautiful statue, in honour of the Queen, I will instruct my tailor not to make you into a pair of fluffy dice for the horns of my war mammoth!" bellowed the King.
"That is certainly a very generous offer, your majesty.  I'll get right on it," said the goblin, bowing obsequiously as he backed out through the door.
"Ah, there you are Wyl.  I have an errand in need of a fine fellow."
"Indeed, your majesty?  Would this errand be dangerous?"
The King laughed loudly and patted Wyl hard on the back, "It is a mere trifle for a hero such as you."
"And where will this errand take me, your majesty?"
"Further west, into uncharted territory.  That's why I need someone with wit and courage to undertake it."
"Wit and courage?"
"Don't be modest Wyl, you have plenty of both.  Oh alright, I need someone who doesn't look like a walking anatomy lesson for this mission."
"Well, I suppose my mother's cooking can wait a little longer."
"Good gnome! Now then, we have discovered documents that suggest the Arcanist had a powerful enemy to the west.  Any enemy of the Arcanist is a friend of ours, but I need a diplomat to locate these new friends and introduce us.  I don't want to scare them, so I thought you would be ideal for the task.  We know very little about this race to the west, so there is some danger, I'm afraid."
"I think I'm getting used to danger."
"That's the spirit.  Now go find the chief scribe and tell him to give you my letters of introduction and the translation glyph.  Then get provisions from the quartermaster.  He has a few interesting little trinkets the Arcanist has no further use for too.  Just take your pick and leave whenever you are ready."
"Thank you, your majesty."
The King swallowed Wyl up in a huge hug and spoke warmly, "Take care young fellow, you and I have much feasting and drinking to do over tall tales, before the spirit-healer takes us for keeps."
"Thank you, your majesty.  I will be careful."
"Now, be on your way, I have a kingdom to build!"
"Aye, farewell."
As the king turned back towards the heap of stone, his pleasant aspect fell away and his broad shoulders sagged.  Even with his back to him, the King sensed Wyl was still there.
He sighed, "It's not for me, my fine friend.  It's for her.  Everything I do, from this day on, I will do her way, with friendship and healing, much as these war-bitten fists are unaccustomed to such subtleties."
"Aye, your majesty."
"You were there with her, at the last?"
"Yes.  She lamented your parting and..."
"I remember clearly the day we first met.  Cocky and carefree I was back then, barely a sergeant, just another foot-slogger really. Her gaze stopped me in my tracks.  I've spent the rest of my days since trying to be worthy of that look.  And yet, she gave it to me freely, every time I looked to her.   She never asked me to earn it."
"She told me to tell your grand-daughter that your love meant more to her than all of her epic deeds."
The King bowed his head for a moment, then said, "And her love meant more to me than any kingdom, yet that is what I am left with.  I shall rebuild it in her name.  Indeed, it shall bear her name.  Henceforth, it shall be known as the kingdom of Suzze."
The King turned to face Wyl, "Once you have completed your business with the chief scribe, tell him to come find me; he has a proclamation to write!"
"Yes, your majesty!"
The King began to look lost in sadness again, then he pulled himself together and ordered, "Get going, Emissary of Suzze!"
Wyl bowed and left.


By mid afternoon, Wyl was following a rough road across wide open grassland.   As he rode up to a fork in the road, he saw a familiar figure, stood contemplating the choice of routes.
"Am I ever going to see what lies behind that mask of yours?" Wyl called out as he approached the rogue.
"I doubt it," said the rogue as she mounted up.
"Pity.  I'm heading west, on an errand for the King.  I really would appreciate some company."
"Still running errands?" said the rogue with a cheeky giggle.
"What is that trinket you keep so close?"
She fingered the small glass vial that hung from a heavy gold chain around her neck, "That tiny drop of fluid... is a single tear. Shed by a man whom I loved and who loved me. He sent it to me when he finally realised that we would never be together again. It is not his sadness, he would never send me that. It's a tear of pure everlasting love. Even after all this time, it has not evaporated."
"Is love truly everlasting?  Remove the stopper from the vial and let's see."
She thought for a moment, then she pulled out the stopper.  Within moments, the tear had dried up and was gone without trace.
Looking deep into her eyes, he whispered softly, "All we have is now."
She snapped the vial from the chain and tossed it away as she spun her mount around alongside his, "You have a special jar too; I suppose you do still have it?"
Wyl pulled the jar from his pack and held it up, "It's the whole reason I came to be here.  Perhaps my whole destiny has been set by what's in this jar.  These two tongues cursed each other with such eternal hate that they became more vitriolic than the acid spit of a rock-wyrm."
"Is hate truly eternal?  Remove the lid from the jar and let's see."
Wyl thought for a moment, then he popped off the lid and poured away the containing potion.
The Tongue of the Undying Warlock began to wriggle, but, instead of uttering a baleful curse, it recited:
The woman is a ripe fruit,
Uneaten, she will but perish.
Devour her you brute!
All her sweet juices, relish.


“At last, we agree on something!” cried the Tongue of the Undying Enchantress:
The heartless and the cruel
Fought for her beating jewel,
But love's passion is the fuel
To bring her sweet renewal.


Wyl dropped the jar, then leant over to the rogue and pulled her mask up over her eyes.
Giggling she said, "What are you doing, silly?"
Wyl whispered softly, "For once, just go with your heart."
Then he kissed her passionately on the lips.  Though slightly startled at first, she soon yielded and with softening lips, kissed him back.  The kiss lingered breathlessly for several moments until their lips slowly parted.  The rogue removed her mask and shivered.
“Are you cold?” asked Wyl.
“No, terrified,” she replied.
“Terrified of what?”
“Happiness,” she said, as she looked warmly into his eyes.
Wyl reached out and squeezed her hand.
"Let's race!" she said.
"West," said Wyl.
On her nod, they both grinned and spurred their mounts to a gallop alongside each other.   The hooves of their beasts thundered upon the heavy earth as they sped across flowing plains of tall grass, with the cooling breeze feeling fresh on their faces. A small shared happiness sprung from within them.
"Ha ha!" Wyl shouted into the wind, "We're not dead! Not yet! Yeee har!"
He whooped and hollered and shouted with defiance, "Life; bring it on!"
In a single flowing movement, the rogue dismissed her mount and leapt onto the back of Wyl's galloping beast.  He felt her arms circle tight around his waist and her head press against his back.
"Love," she laughed, "bring it on!"


  And their arcane gods smiled down upon them, at least for now.
