VORTEX

TRAVEL BY NIGHT _ GUIDED BY STARS

Again came the morning and the familiar heartache, but the Shroom Bread was gone and so was the rogue.
"Are you stealthed again? I wish you wouldn't do that!" Wyl cried out.
There was a reply, faint with distance, "You go on your way; I'll go mine."
Wyl was tired and upset, so he didn't bother to respond.
"At least the sun is shining," he mumbled to himself as he watched the reflections glitter on the sea.
He called inland, to the rogue, “Farewell then.  I must go on, across the sea.”
He soon had the dinghy relaunched and sailed steadily without event, for a few hours.  During the afternoon, storm clouds began to gather ahead.  As the wind picked up the sky grew heavy and very dark.


Wyl hove-to and let out the main-sheet to wait-out the storm.  He lay back in the rocking boat, feeling a little sleepy despite the pitching.  Then, he thought he heard a whisper, over the sound of wind and water.  Then again, a single word.  He strained to hear it clearly.  It was repeated but he still couldn't make it out.
"Rogue?  Is that you?"
The whispering became more frequent, but was still barely audible.  Wyl sat up slowly and looked about, yet there was nothing to see around the boat apart from the dark water.  Gradually though, as his eyes became accustomed to the gloom, he made out a shoal of hippocampi swimming around the dinghy.  It seemed very odd, but they were definitely circling the boat.  And the longer he watched them, the more convinced he became, that it was these little seahorses that were whispering!
Wyl was so intent on making out what they were saying, that he even held his breath.
He could just begin to make out a word, "… whirls ..."
He leant further out, to hear better the tiny voices, "… little whirls ..."
They were repeating the same rhythmic chant over and over, so very quietly.
"Big whirls ... little whirls ... lesser whirls ..."
"Yes!" Wyl shouted in triumph when he got it:
Big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity,
And little whirls have lesser whirls and so on to vorticity.


The susurration went on and on, as the tiny, sparkling school maintained an unbroken slowly spinning circle around the boat, without change in tempo or amplitude.  Then Wyl became aware that the boat was moving, somehow propelled by the circulating action of the shoal.  Or was it?  Wyl's sense of space and time had become confused.  He felt a little dizzy.  He tipped back his head to take a deep breath and was shocked to see stars whizzing around the sky like sparks from a catherine wheel!  Day had become night! The whole celestial arc was spinning rapidly, as if the boat was turning fast beneath it.
The seahorse whispering continued on and on; the stars were moving so fast now, that the blackness of the night sky was coloured-in with the brightness of the stellar streaks, until the whole of the heavenly dome was bright with starlight!  Wyl felt a lightness in the pit of his stomach, as if he was being propelled downward at some incredible speed.  The dizziness increased until he swooned into a fitful dream.


Boyhood; that is where the dream took him, standing at the door to the classroom of his Master of Magics, who sat at his desk talking sternly to a senior girl pupil.
He beckoned Wyl to enter, “Come in and take a seat for a moment Wyl,” said the Grand Wizard.
Wyl took a seat by the door in the otherwise empty classroom.
The Grand Wizard turned his attention back to the other pupil, "It can't be done with positive energy density everywhere.  The causality violations appear in a finite region of space-time without curvature singularities.  There will be a Cauchy horizon that is compactly generated and that contains one or more closed null geodesics which will be incomplete. If the causality violation developed from a non-compact initial surface, the averaged weak energy condition must be violated on the Cauchy horizon."
The girl seemed only momentarily rebuffed before she mustered a confident response,"That does not rule out the possibility of non-compactly generated Cauchy horizons or regions which contain exotic matter, not to mention quantum gravity!"
The Grand Wizard sighed, “Okay Pippa, I look forward to reading that paper once you have the theory fully developed.  In the meantime, would you please do me the courtesy of returning your homework on time, so I might read that instead.  That will be all, thank you."
Wisely, the girl quit while the honours appeared even and promptly left the classroom.


The Grand Wizard raised his eyes to the ceiling, then looked at Wyl and smiled, "Don't look so worried, young Wyl.  I asked you to stay behind because you show such exceptional promise.  In fact, I think you're ready for some extra lessons.  I want to introduce you to a new teacher; a teacher who will broaden and deepen your knowledge in ways that the normal curriculum here doesn't offer.  Of course, it would mean extra work.  Are you interested?"
"Er, yes.  Thank you, Grand Wizard."
"Good.  Now then, there is something else I must do first.  But please come with me, you may find this educational too."
The Grand Wizard stood and conjured a portal.
"Come," he said as he stepped through.  Wyl followed immediately.  They stepped out onto a large neat lawn surrounded by tall clipped hedges and adjacent to a rambling country mansion.  A few people lay on the grass here and there, soaking up the warm evening sunshine.  A night-elf in a white coat noticed their appearance and walked over to meet them.
"Good evening, Grand Wizard," she said as she dipped her head slightly in deference.
"Good evening, Doctor.  This is Wyl, one of my most accomplished students."
"Welcome, Wyl," said the doctor.
"Good evening," said Wyl.
"I am so glad you could attend today, Grand Wizard.  I am afraid the patient's condition is deteriorating as predicted."
"Oh dear.  May I see her?"
"Certainly.  This way please."
As they followed the doctor across the lawn, the Grand Wizard explained in hushed tones, "This, young mage, is a place neither you or I would wish to end up."
"It's a hospital?"
"Sort of.  This is The Institute of Magical Health.  These patients you see here are all suffering from a very serious condition.  At one time they were all mages, sorcerers, witches, warlocks... that is, people of pronounced magical ability.  But now, they have lost all sense of magic.  They no-longer believe in magic.  They have lost all touch with reality."
"They're all mad?"
"Utterly.  Sad isn't it?  Imagine yourself, entirely cut-off from your inner spirit, without your keen sense of wonder in the magical nature of the world."
Wyl shuddered at the thought. "Is there no cure?"
"The doctors here work tirelessly in search of one.  But, none has yet been discovered.  There are some promising avenues of research.  For example, a recent study has shown that certain love philtres stimulate a very weak and temporary belief in magic.  One theory, that is very much in vogue, is that true love, the real thing and not some apothecary's simulation, would indeed cure the afflicted.  However, the critics of the theory claim that one has to believe in magic to ever fall in love.  This topic will be hotly debated for some time yet, I fear."
"Here she is, Grand Wizard," said the doctor, as she pointed out a frumpy old woman sat on a wooden bench.  She was sitting still and relaxed with a distant, vacant stare.
"Thank you, doctor.  Wyl, allow me to introduce my wife, The Great Golden Sorceress of the Seven Golden Dawns."
"Oh, hello dear," said the twee little woman to Wyl.  "Take no notice of him," she winked, "he's a bit loopy!"
"My dear," said the Grand Wizard, "your shoelace is undone."
"Oh my, so it is." said the woman, as she stooped to tie it.
Wyl and the Grand Wizard watched her struggle to tie the lace for several minutes.  Then the Grand Wizard stooped and kissed her on the cheek, "Goodbye, my dear," he said sadly as he turned and motioned Wyl and the doctor to follow him.
"You see? Once upon a time she would have just snapped her fingers.  I hope this hasn't upset you, young mage.  Your coming of age is near, so it is as well you should see something of the wider world, warts and all."
The Grand Wizard conjured another portal and turned to the doctor, "Thank you, doctor.  Please make her as comfortable as you can.  Goodbye."
Then he turned to Wyl, "Come, I shall now introduce you to someone who is in full command of all her magical faculties.  Of that, there is no doubt."


Suddenly, the dreaming sleep ended, as, with an involuntary groan, Wyl leant over starboard and wretched only air and saliva, his eyes screwed tight with the pain of the convulsions.  As the spasms subsided, he raised his head and squinted through his tears.  He was astonished to find himself looking at dry sunlit sand, rather than dark water!  He sat up quickly and looked around.  He was still in the boat, but the boat lay in a sandy desert!  In fact, the weathered coral-encrusted rocks nearby indicated straight away that this was a dried up seabed!  Casting his gaze farther afield, Wyl was further amazed by what he saw.  The sands were littered with the crumbling abandoned hulks of boats and ships of all kinds, from small boats like his, to yachts to frigates to galleons.  It looked like a ship graveyard and it stretched for miles.  There was no sign of the multitude of sailors that must have piloted these vessels, to this world bereft of sea; not even a vacant skull or a rusty cutlass.  He felt a deep foreboding; this place, was a last resting place.


He stepped from the boat and began to walk towards a rocky outcrop that he hoped would provide a vantage point.  The air was hot, dry and dusty.  He conjured a pouch of fresh spring water and took a few swigs as he walked, relishing the buzz as the manna revitalised his wizardly powers.  As he approached the base of the outcrop, his feet crunched upon the bleached bones of fishes.  For a split second, Wyl envisaged the fish crowded together in the rock-pool in the shade of the promontory, gasping as the last vestige of a once mighty ocean dwindled away beneath an unforgiving sun.  He tried to think no more about it as he passed over them.  He scrambled up the side of the rocky outcrop, gaining easy purchase on the ancient corals, but reaching the flat top sweaty and out of breath.  He stood to look around.  The ancient seabed stretched unbroken in all directions except for where it met a ridge of sheer cliffs in one direction and, in the opposite direction, some way off, where there appeared to be an oasis.  He looked again at the cliffs, then back at the oasis, thinking every sailor before him must have chosen the oasis.  What sirens might he find there?  Perhaps this was the final destination of every sailor on the seas of fate?  Perhaps this was his final destination?  Perhaps this was the Isle of Disenchantment?  He scrambled back down from the rock, summoned his mount and set off toward the oasis.
