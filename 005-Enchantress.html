<p class="intro">
Within a short time, he was close enough to discern a large walled house of Moorish design nestled among tall palms.
It shimmered in the desert heat, so much at times that Wyl wondered if it might be a mirage.  The fierce sun burned remorselessly.
The hot dust scratched his throat and clogged his lungs.  Though he trudged steadily onwards, the palm fringed oasis seemed to get no nearer.
He stopped several times to drink until his stock of spring water was depleted.
When he conjured more, he realised his manna was ebbing away,  or perhaps being sucked from him.  He felt so hot and so weary.
His mount was struggling to breathe as it ascended a sand dune, then it suddenly de-materialised and Wyl found himself dumped onto the hot sand.
His tongue felt dry and swollen as it swept slowly across his cracked lips.  His vision was blurred and he was confused.
Where was the oasis?  He scrambled to the top of the dune in a panic.  Ah, there it was.
He stumbled on, feeling as if the sun was burning a hole into his head.  He tripped and fell.
He found himself entangled in a pile of dry bones and pitted armour.
He stood wearily to look upon the fallen warrior and found there were the remains of three, around a long dead camp-fire.
Perhaps they had accepted their fate and just joined together in a final meal, before the desert dried their bones?
Wyl fell to his knees, vehemently wishing he could extinguish the sun!  Was this it?  Was this the end?
How ironic, that he should die here in this baking dessert!  He slumped into a sweaty heap, eyes closed, mouth parched.
He thought of home, a place of permanent snow and frost.  He thought then of the day he left.
</p>
<p>
He had known her for most of his life, yet they stood together in awkward silence, looking along the frozen dirt road that wound out of the valley and beyond.
The incessant wind wailed over the icy ridge and whispered its goodbyes, while the snow flurries swirled around them, as if urging them back together.
He looked at her pretty white face, an icy jewel in a white frozen landscape.  Their frosted breaths danced and mingled until the wind tore them away.
<br/>"Please don't leave," she begged tearfully.
<br/>He found no words fit to say.  He felt his resolve begin to weaken, but he let his welling tears freeze over before they rose past his heart.
He set his jaw and reset his gaze along the road out of the valley.  He wondered to himself, why, in a land so cold, she offered no warmth, only her pain.
<br/>"Goodbye," he said, as he turned and walked away into the cold lemon of the early morning sun, without ever daring to look back.
</p>
<p>
No! He would not die here in this dessert of the forsaken!  When his time came, he would lay down his bones where they belonged, beneath the permafrost.
He concentrated hard and cast Blink.  The oasis did appear a little closer.  He walked slowly towards it and it seemed to get no nearer.
He cast Blink again; yes, it was closer, but his manna was too low to get him there.
</p>
<p>
Then he remembered the Seven Leaf Clover.
He took it from his backpack and cast its spell.  Suddenly, it felt like a beautiful day as if everything was going his way.
<br/>"Well Krackle, you did say it would make a little luck go a long way!"
<br/>He cast Blink once more.  It worked! He was standing beneath the shade of a palm, respite at last from the relentless sun.
A freshwater spring burbled at the centre of a small pool.
He waded in and scooped handfuls of the cool water into his mouth and let the refreshing water trickle over his face.
He sat in the pool, momentarily underwater, then sprang up feeling much revived.  He then sloshed out of the water up to the house.
</p>
<p>
Even close-up, it still shimmered.  He recognized it for what it was; a dream house; an enchanter's snare; a place of illusions,
where the magics and physics of the real world no longer applied. If he were not very careful, he would remain captivated by some sweet
delight within the dream house and never leave. His real body would wither and rot, while his soul became a figment of the dream for evermore.
But he must enter, for somewhere within the dream house lay the object of his quest. He rummaged through his backpack and pulled out an alarm clock.
He set the alarm to go off in one hour, dream-time, then popped it back into his backpack.
As he reached for the doors, they swung slowly inward of their own accord.  Wyl stepped cautiously into the cool hallway and stood still for a moment,
as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom.  The only sounds were the distant ghostly echoes of children laughing, like innocents lost in limbo.
</p>
<p>
The double doors at the far end of the hallway swung open to reveal a beautiful and elegant lady.
Her lips were red and full, her eyes were brilliant blue. Her strawberry-blonde hair hung past her shoulders.
Her gently heaving bosom drew attention to her hour-glass figure.
<br/>"Time is a thief," she said darkly, with a trace of sadness in her voice, "Inexorable, irreversible and stealthier than any rogue.
It takes from us all of the things we hold most dear.  Most unforgivably, it takes from us the people we love."
<br/>"How true."
<br/>"You feel a deep sense of loss, in your heart.  A lost love?  What happened to her?"
<br/>"Last I heard, she was running the orphanage in Stormwind."
<br/>"Laudable."
<br/>"Mmmm, but what a price for such a bright mind and brave heart to pay."
<br/>"The children must need her care."
<br/>"Yes and she will set them off on their way in the wide world, while for her, the whole of Azeroth lies undiscovered."
<br/>"She made her choice."
<br/>"Yes, she did."
<br/>"And you made yours."
<br/>"Yes."
<br/>The lady smiled and her demeanour lightened, "Please do come," she said, "we can talk in the garden."
</p>
<p>
She spun effortlessly around and the sunlight cascading through the ornate windows caressed her, as she swept majestically along. Wyl could do nought but follow.
<br/>"So, you have the tongue of my former husband," she said in a matter of fact tone, but with a cheeky sideways glance.
<br/>Wyl was startled by her foreknowledge, but kept his composure, "Indeed."
<br/>She giggled, "You know, he used to say that I had a wicked tongue!"
<br/>"Surely, you jest," Wyl laughed nervously.
</p>
<p>
A large wooden door swung open before them and they strolled out into a rose garden.
Amongst the roses stood many life-size statues of people: mariners, warriors and others.
They continued walking beneath the rose-arbour. The scents and colours in the dappled shade were enchanting.
<br/>"Jest? Not I sir," she said, smiling as she tilted her head seductively, "Perhaps you came for my tongue too, to make up the pair?"
<br/>"Er, well..."
<br/>She stopped and inhaled deeply, "Ah, don't the roses smell wonderful."
<br/>"Er, yes..."
<br/>"I have created many new varieties. I get such joy from bringing a new beauty to the world."
<br/>"Here, this is one of my favourite scents," she said, sniffing a bright yellow rose hanging from the column beside her, "Ah.  See what you think of that."
<br/>Wyl leant forward and pretended to take a deep breath, suddenly wary lest the rose be a poison trap. "Mmmm, delicious.  You are clearly a very accomplished horticulturist."
</p>
<p>
They strolled together exploring the beautiful colours, textures and scents of the many and varied varieties within the garden.
Though he hadn't hitherto been interested in rose-growing, her passion and enthusiasm for the subject was infectious.
As they chatted, Wyl sensed a genuine warmth growing between them.  They talked of many things and found common delight in each other's anecdotes.
They found they shared a similar sense of humour that brought much laughter.
</p>
<p>
As they turned a corner, Wyl saw a small group of intense-blue climbing-roses in the border ahead.
They were twined around a group of stone statues, of children dancing in a circle.
<br/>"Wow! They are incredible.  How did you get that colour?" he exclaimed.
<br/>"Wait until you smell the scent," she said, drawing one of the blue roses to his nose.
<br/>Wyl took the rose, but as he breathed its scent, he pricked his thumb on a thorn. A small drop of blood ran from his thumb.
<br/>"Here, let me," she said.
<br/>As she took his thumb between her luscious lips, they looked deep into each other's eyes.
<br/>"I... couldn't smell anything," Wyl said.
<br/>She sucked hard on his thumb for a moment, then slipped it from her warm, moist mouth.
<br/>"I smell the scent of my lost children," she said, with tears forming in her eyes.
<br/>The end of Wyl's thumb felt strangely numb. As he looked at it, he could see it had turned to stone, but he felt oddly detached and unalarmed; in fact, he felt slightly intoxicated.
<br/>"The statues?"
<br/>"Dead, but dreaming."
<br/>She held her hand to his cheek, still looking into his eyes, smiling sadly, "Sweet Wyl. We are so alike, you and I, both prisoners of our own dreams.
But is it truly a prison, where one accepts the confines and has no desire to leave?"
<br/>"You tricked me."
<br/>"You came here of your own free will, because I have something you need.  You knew the risks."
<br/>By now his whole arm was stone, "I suppose so."
<br/>The creeping fossilization was moving rapidly.  Wyl could barely breathe and his vision was blurred.
And yet he still thought she looked wonderful, all aglow within a charming pinkish haze.
<br/>He just managed to whisper, "Rose-coloured spectacles."
<br/>She smiled, "I will fulfil all of your deepest desires.  All things are possible within the vortex of our minds; dreams within dreams within dreams."
<br/>He blinked and she was gone, leaving only the warmth of her hand on his cheek.
<br/>In another moment, the rose garden dissolved into a bright haze, until...
</p>
<p>
His heart missed a beat when he suddenly saw her; a girl on a swing, his lost love from many years ago.
She was still ravishingly beautiful. She looked wise but not old; curvaceous but not heavy.
Time and his heartbeat seemed to slow, to the serene rhythm of her swinging.
Her  bodice of silver filigree and delicate white lace hinted at her dark nipples beneath.
With each swing, her full bosom bobbed gently and her gossamer skirt fluttered behind her.
Her smooth, olive skin looked edible.  Her full, plum lips were pouted, her eyes were dark and deep.
Her nose was petite and cute. Her jet-black hair bobbed in slow motion, atop her swan-like neck,
as she reached the zenith and it streamed back from her broad grin, as she arced downward again.
Swing.  Swing.  Swing.  Vivacious and vibrant, she made the enchantress seem plain by comparison.
</p>
<p>
Though agog, he managed to stutter, "You're... still as beautiful... as I remember... you."
<br/>"Thank you," she smiled, "I still wear the pendant you gave me, though who knows whether its magic still works, after all this time."
<br/>"You bought it yourself, remember? One of many things I should have done.  I always was useless at buying gifts for you."
<br/>"Well, it reminds me of you. Especially when I am feeling lonely."
<br/>"Lonely? Surely not. You are so beautiful!"
<br/>She slipped from the swing and skipped up to him.  As she brushed a lock of his hair from his forehead, she said, "I have tried others; they're just not you."
<br/>He basked in the unwavering radiance of her smile.  Sensing her hot breath upon his lips, his mouth watered as he thought to kiss her.
The old, deep feelings washed through him again, in wave after wave, as they always had whenever he was with her.
The surging tide of warmth within him broke into a wide smile, as he pressed against her.
<br/>"Oh beautiful, precious lady. Such sweet, sweet memories."
<br/>"Yes, memories," she whispered breathlessly, as her wet tongue glossed her pouted lips.
<br/>Their sultry gazes locked, they leant imperceptibly slowly together, until they could sense each other's lips without actually touching,
breathing each other's breaths, melting into each other's aura.
<br/>"I could linger here for eternity."
<br/>"But this isn't real."
<br/>"I am so sorry, for all those forlorn hopes. You saw them for what they were, long before I did."
<br/>"Goodbye, lovely man."
<br/>"Goodbye, sweet lady."
<br/>For a few moments of wonder filled reverie, he recalled the sensation of falling into the bright knowing that shone from her deep, dark eyes;
the honeyed passion of her tender kisses; his soul resting safely in her embrace.
<br/>He knew the dream was taking hold of all his faculties, but, he wondered, would it be so bad, to spend eternity within this dream?
<br/>"Oh sweet, sweet lady, how I have missed your heart, beating next to mine."
<br/>"We cannot be real though."
<br/>"We once shared a dream, perhaps we can share this one."
<br/>"Is it open, honest, fine, pure?"
<br/>"No.  But I am no longer certain that matters."
<br/>"Perhaps we will find such a dream one day," she whispered, with a tearful smile that said it did matter.
<br/>His eyes filled with tears too.
</p>
<p>
Then he felt himself falling away from her.  He could see her speaking, but could not catch her words.
She ran towards him, but in slow time, so that they moved further apart.  She removed the pendant and threw it to him.
It twisted and turned through the air in slower and slower motion.  A bright fog swirled around her and she disappeared as he reached out to catch the pendant.
</p>
<p>
He was falling, falling, falling, slowly and dizzily, through luminous swirling clouds.
Eventually, as the clouds cleared, he landed softly on his hands and knees, atop a warm sandy hill.
As his dizziness cleared, he stood and looked around, to see a vast machine of shining, whirling metal, spread across the broad plain before him, like a great mechanical city.
The air hummed and the ground throbbed in rhythm with its awesome dynamics.
Huge pistons thrust this way and that, while massive wheels and cogs spun and meshed.
The roar of the great engine washed through his soul like a mighty sacred river.
</p>
<p>
He began to notice subtle rhythms and beats; a sublime music that made him want to tap his feet and bob his head in time.
He began a cadenced walk toward the mechanistic metropolis, but the walk soon became a joyful dance!
Very soon, he stood next to a great whirling armature and placed his hand upon the huge metallic beam that supported it.
Within the tumult of harmonic vibrations that coursed through his fingertips, he sensed a vague arrhythmia.
As he focused on the disharmony, it grew into a cry from within the great machine. It called to his soul; a mournful plea for mechanical healing.
His engineer's instincts were already formulating ideas on the cause of the problem. He knew he could fix it.
He knew it would need a lot of work; perhaps it would be the work of a lifetime, but he was just the one to do it!
It was an engineer's dream. How he wished his father were here with him now; they would work on it together until their knuckles bled oil.
Then, off in the distance, made hazy by the exhaust gases of the great machine, Wyl could just make out a familiar figure, stooped intently over a stuttering mechanism.
<br/>"Dad? Dad!"
<br/>He ran towards the man, who looked round as he approached and then stood square and tall. The man smiled and held his arms wide open.
<br/>"My son! At last, you've come to help me," he said, his voice filled with warmth and gratitude, "I have toiled alone for so long."
<br/>Wyl jumped into that strong embrace and was held there, tight and warm as the air throbbed with the thunderous grand opera of the great machine.
Wyl felt so at home in that strong embrace. So loved. So cherished. Ding-a-ling. Ding-a-ling. Ding-a-ling. The alarm clock!
</p>

<p>
He was wrenched painfully from the dream and back to reality. His eyes filled with tears as the vision of his father faded.
Instead, he was confronted by the enchantress in her true harpy form. And standing beside the harpy, a stone statue that shocked his sadness into rage; the form of his long lost love, in an attitude of fear and resignation.
Caught by surprise, the harpy hissed and screeched as she flapped her shimmering feather wings, trying to take off while slashing at Wyl with her talons.
Wyl's fury fired him into instant action.
He caught her full-on with his Frost Nova and froze her to the spot.  Then he hurled fireball after fireball, seething with a vicious determination to obliterate her!
He realised he still had the pendant in his hand, so he stuffed it into his pack, then grabbed his wand and took aim.
But the harpy was already staggering beneath the ferocity of his attack.  She fell backwards into the roses, her beautiful plumage frazzling in the flames.
The roses wrapped around her.  As the thorns bit her flesh, small rivulets of blood ran down to the rich soil.
As her flesh began to crystallize to stone, she called out a blood curdling screech.
</P>
<p>
Suddenly, the rogue appeared and with a single swish of her dagger, cut out the harpy's tongue.
<br/>"Did you forget what you came for?" she admonished as she displayed the bloody trophy.
<br/>Wyl looked down at the harpy.  Her bloody grimace was set in stone.
<br/>"Quick! The jar!" shouted the rogue.
<br/>Wyl pulled the jar from his pack and handed it over. The rogue popped up the lid and dropped the tongue into the potion.
<br/>"And what did you come for?"
<br/>"Well, I figured there'd be rich pickings."
<br/>"Help yourself," Wyl said dismissively.
<br/>"I intend to," the rogue said firmly.
<p>
A stiff breeze suddenly sprang up, blowing dust into their eyes.
Wyl rubbed his eyes and then opened them again to see to see that the rogue had vanished and that a portal was opening a few yards away.
A mage in a deep purple robes stepped from the portal and looked down at the statue of the enchantress.
</p>
<p>
The face of the mage turned purple with rage as he screamed at Wyl, "What have you done?!"
</p>
<p>
Before Wyl could react, the mage began casting.
The fight of frost and fire was short and brutal; Wyl didn't land a single hit before he was overpowered by the purple mage.
As the last of his life force ebbed away, Wyl collapsed onto the stone path and looked up at the scowling mage as the world went dark.
</p>
<p>
Wyl's ghost stood at the graveyard in the grey world of death.
He turned away from the spirit healer to search for his corpse, but after a short while walking he was surprised to see another ghost approaching,
that of a young dwarf priestess.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, they stood face to face.
<br/>"Wyl of Ironforge?" asked the priestess.
<br/>"How do you know me?"
<br/>"Oft have I observed you within my scrying bowl.  My name is Suzze, I have a quest for you."
<br/>"A quest for a ghost?"
<br/>"Not exactly, though the quest does require you to forgo ressurection just yet.
In fact, it is a long quest chain. You should know that it would require you to diverge from your current life for some time."
<br/>"My current life? Not sure I know what that is anymore."
<br/>"Then perhaps the scrying was true and this quest is indeed your destiny."
