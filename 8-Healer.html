SUZZE


They searched for an hour before they came across the Queen.  She was lashed to a wooden post that had once stood vertical, but that now lay on the hot sand.  Grim faced and silent, the King cut the bindings and lay her softly on the ground.  Wyl watched in silence as the King knelt over his consort.  She must once have been very beautiful, but now, her face and body were dry and brittle, sorely ravaged by time and the elements and who knows what demonic torments.  The mighty warlord cupped her face in his massive hands, as gently as if she was a delicate bird.  He put his lips to what was left of hers.  Then, as tears trickled down his cheeks, he kissed her slowly and passionately.  Without breaking the kiss, he took hold of the pendant around his neck and lifted it over his head.
"Your Majesty!" Wyl shouted in alarm.
But the king took no notice as he slipped the pendant over the head of his beloved.  The head of the King suddenly shot back as he was racked by the grimaced agony of his death throes.  Then the air hissed from between his lips as his head slowly sank onto the bosom of his queen.  He lay there dead and still, the death pallor restored.
The pendant flickered and its enchantment brought the dead queen to life with a start.  Her eyes blinked open and her bosom heaved as she inhaled a deep breath. Her skin grew firm and supple across her form and a mistletoe wreath grew like a crown upon her head.  She raised her hands and placed them gently on the head of her dead king.  With a slight but deeply affectionate smile, she stroked his hair softly.
Then she bit on her lip as tears streamed down her face, "Oh my darling, must we spend another eternity apart?"
She stroked him and kissed him and rocked him in her arms, weeping all the while.  Finally, she laid him gently on his back and folded his arms across his chest.  He looked the epitome of the fallen hero.  She put one last lingering kiss upon his lips and then got unsteadily to her feet.


Looking into the sky, she said, "Have no fear, young mage.  The alignment is at hand."
Wyl looked up but saw nothing except blue sky and a hot afternoon sun.
She looked down at the body of the King, although her gaze seemed somehow distant, "Serve him well.  And when you next meet my grand daughter, tell her that above all the tales of epic deeds, I would have her remember that I was once dearly loved by a good man, as he was loved by me."
Then she lifted one hand straight into the air and a small blue flame flickered at her fingertips.  The flame grew into an ectoplasmic aura that streamed up into the sky, higher and higher and higher, until it seemed to touch the sun itself.
There was a distant rumble, then the earth began to shake violently.  Wyl struggled to keep his feet.  The blue stream gushed more furiously from the hand of the queen and Wyl watched in awe as the sun rapidly set!  As darkness fell, two moons rose rapidly in the east!  Within moments, the celestial dome became starry and moonlit, day had become night!  Wyl couldn't say whether the queen was using some dread magic to move the sun, or rotate the whole of Azeroth, or merely tuning into some massive planetary realignment she had foreknowledge of.  He just knew he was witnessing a display of magical power beyond anything he had ever seen before.
The earth was shaking so violently now that Wyl fell over.  He decided it was safer to stay on the ground while the air was filled with a deafening continuous rumble, as if mountains were colliding.


Then, the queen raised her other arm and more ectoplasmic streams formed.  This time they seemed to connect to the two moons that were quickly processing across the sky.  Wyl was in fear for his life, it felt as if Azeroth was breaking apart!  He lay flat and covered his head with his hands.  The crashing and banging got louder and louder until Wyl's ears hurt as he was tossed up and down by the bucking of the earth! He curled up in a ball, eyes screwed shut and waited for the final catastrophe.  Then his ears suddenly popped and all he could hear was a faint soprano singing.  The angelic harmonies grew steadily louder and higher.


He realised the ground was no longer shaking.  He sensed a warmth like the heat from a blazing log fire.  He opened his eyes to look at the queen.  She was still standing there.  Ectoplasmic streams seemed to be flowing into her arms from the two moons, which were now high and stationary, one above the other, in perfect vertical alignment with the zenith.  Tiny motes of flame were forming around the queen and radiating out in all directions.  Wyl could see the motes passing him.  They bathed the whole landscape in an eerie orange glow.  He focussed on the queen again and saw that she was almost skeletal, her flesh was peeling away to form the fiery motes.  Yet she stood firm, like an antennae directing the supernatural energy of the alignment.  The singing grew louder still, with an irresistible sweetness that caressed his heart and whispered to his soul.


Wyl looked around and suddenly realised that the glorious singing was coming from a great host of ghostly spirit-healers who hovered above the vast swathe of corpses, from one end of the battlefield to the other.  They were beaming down their life-giving essence upon the dead and reanimating them!  The fallen warriors of Azeroth were slowly resuscitating, as if arising from some deep drugged sleep.  A few were standing, but most were kneeling or sitting, looking dazed and confused.


Wyl quickly stood up and looked around.  Yes, it was true, the queen was using her unfathomable power to resurrect the entire army!  The king was risen already.  He stood, looking pained but resolute, watching the body of his beloved dissipate as she fed her healing essence into the great healing spell.  Wyl now sensed what the King had known; the army would be reborn, but the Queen would die.


The ectoplasmic streams suddenly sputtered out, the rebirthing complete.  The spirit-healers faded away, their warmth and song replaced by a chill wind.  The Queen was now nothing more than a pile of dry bones at the feet of her lover.  The King stood in silent contemplation for a few moments.  Then he turned to address the army from atop the small knoll, "Warriors of Azeroth and beyond, whatever we once were, we now stand united in our rebirth.  Queen Suzze is now the mother of us all.  We shall avenge her, and right the wrong that has scarred this landscape for these centuries past.  We shall crush the Arcanist and his foul army!  We shall tear down every stone of his vile citadel!  And we shall close for ever his portal to the nether regions!  Arise, spawn of Suzze!  Arise and prepare for battle!"
There was a great cheer and then a clamour as the army stirred and went about its preparations.


The King turned to Wyl, "Wait hereabouts, young mage.  I shall see to it that someone comes to give you your battle orders."
Then the King barked out commands to officers here and there and as a huddle they moved off amongst the army, issuing further commands as they went.


DARKNATURE


Wyl joined a knot of troops standing nearby, around the warm glow of a camp-fire they had just got going.  The warmth raised his spirits as he stared idly into the flames.  A chirpy goblin wandered among the throng, vending various performance enhancing goods.
"Hydra's Teeth, anybody?  Roll up, roll up!  Loadsa special offers, for today only!"
One or two bought things from him.  Then he moved towards Wyl.
"Hydra's Teeth!  Dragon's Doughnuts!  All at bargain prices, for one day only!"
He stepped up to Wyl, "Hello friend. What do you need?"
"Nothing thanks, I have plenty."
The goblin turned away and continued proclaiming his wares, "Undead's Underpants! Faerie Fire Faggots!  Come on! You know you need 'em!  These offers will never be repeated!"
"Hey, tauren!  You look like a mighty warrior to me, how about some Giant's Sweetbreads? They won't be goin' at these prices tomorrow!"
The huge warrior turned and said firmly, "I'm a dwarf."
Everyone about fell suddenly silent.
The goblin laughed, "Well friend, I have a good head for figures and I'd say you were at least ten feet tall."
The warrior bellowed furiously, "I! Am! A! Dwarf!  Yes, my mother was a dwarf!  Yes, my father was a dwarf!  Yes, they were both less than four feet tall!  No, I didn't have any tall uncles who visited from time to time, while dad was away!"
The goblin gulped nervously but then pitched right back, "Yes!  I see it now, the horned helmet threw me.  Warrior though, right?  Want some Giant's Sweetbreads?  My friend, this is your lucky day!  It just so happens they are buy-one-get-one-free to any dwarf over nine feet tall!"
The warrior resumed his firm but quieter voice, "No thanks.  Got somethin' better."
"Better?  These are the finest available.  There is no better!"
"Titan's Testicles. Plucked 'em m'self."
The goblin didn’t even blink, "You know my friend, I have one hell of a business proposition for you!  I'm sure you're gonna love it! Let's talk."
The rest of the exchange was lost to Wyl as the goblin lead the warrior away in conversation.


He stood warming himself by the fire, looking dreamily into the dancing flames.  Ah, radiant warmth.  He could almost smell his mother's cake, as he imagined her lifting it from the oven.  He recalled her words, the last time he tasted a slice, "You should look to a future beyond this cold valley.  Find a nice town somewhere and settle down; perhaps the great city of Ironforge, or even further afield."
He recalled the look of sharp pain in her eyes that belied her smile; the umbilical cut.
"Well, Mum, here I am, much further afield" he whispered to himself.


His reverie was broken by a nudge and a gruff voice, "'Ere young'un, wanna smoke?"
Wyl looked up at a dark night-elf druid, who was offering him a cigarette.
"Er, no thank you, I don't."
"Suit yerself," said the druid as he popped the fag into his own mouth and reached into the fire for a burning ember to light it with.  He puffed until he got the cigarette lit and threw the twig back on the fire.
"You should be ashamed," said a priest, from across the fire, "A healer, smoking!  I can see the shadow damage it does with each puff."
"Yeah, yeah, heard it all before mate," said the druid as he healed himself with a nonchalant wave, "I been a ghost in limbo for a hundred years, gaspin'!"
The priest tutted as he left.
"Don't forget to pray for me!" the druid called after him.
The priest gave no reply and soon disappeared amongst the throng.
The druid looked at Wyl through the corner of his eyes as he blew smoke at a tangent, "Best you don't smoke though, young'un.  You're no healer, so don't go livin' yer life as if yer were.  Us healers needs summink to steady us nerves.  It's no picnic, in the thick o' battle, tryin' to keep everyone around yer alive.  An' if we wipe, who gets the blame?  Healer, that's who.  No wonder so many o' us smokes.  An' tomorrow, well, we'll be fallin' like snowflakes into a volcano."
A dwarven warrior, with more brass in her voice than she had in her ornate breastplate, slipped up beside the druid and put her arm around him, "Hey, Darknature!  Still as miserable as ever.  Tomorrow will come soon enough, but the night is yet young, so, come cast again your sweet, sweet spell of lurve."
"See yer later," winked the druid to Wyl, as the couple went off giggling.


Wyl was left to console himself with the warmth of the fire.  He recalled the day he first journeyed through the mountain tunnel from Dun Morogh down to Loch Modan.  He'd never before seen countryside that wasn't covered in snow and ice, so he was fascinated by how green it all was.  Grasses grew everywhere.  He'd pulled a handful of grain from a roadside tuft and a tiny delicate bird had flown into the palm of his hand, to peck at the seed.  He could still feel the fluttering heartbeat of that fragile bird, even now.  For the first time in his life, he'd felt real warmth.


A troll warrior, who was shadow boxing as he walked, emerged from the gloom with an orc hunter.  A rogue standing across the fire, shouted to the hunter, "Hey Drix! Where you goin' with dat gun in your hand?
"I'm goin down to shoot dat magi.  You know dey caught 'im messin' 'round wid anudder demon.  An' dat ain't too cool!"
"Shoot him one more time for me, baby!"
The rogue then addressed the troll, "Jimi! Hey! Still champ' of the unarmed eh?"
The troll stood square before the rogue and punched the air, with amazing speed, either side of the rogue's head, while singing, "I stand up next to a mountain, chop it down with the edge of my hand. I pick up all the pieces and make an island, might even raise a little sand.  'Cause I'm a voodoo child, baby."
"There's no reason to get excited," the rogue he kindly spoke, "there are many here among us who feel that life is but a game.  But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate.  So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's gettin' late."
The troll stopped punching the air and laughed, "Well of course, I'm packing a little something extra," he grinned, pulling a huge two-handed axe from his pack, "Deep Cleavage; she'll feast tomorrow!"
The rogue laughed and tapped knuckles with them both.
“We hear Fisher McTavish reeled in a barrel o' grog.  Wanna come check it out?” said the hunter.
“Sure,” said the rogue.
As Wyl watched them head down to the beach, laughing and cavorting, he envied them their battle-tested friendships.


A couple of human paladins came by.  One pointed at Wyl and said, “Hey mage, I hear they're looking for gnomes to join an elite unit.”
Wyl looked up at the pair.
The other paladin said, “Yeah, their mission is to sow havoc amongst the enemy rear-guard.”
Wyl was about to explain he was waiting for special orders from the King, when they both guffawed loudly, “It's the Suicide Punt Squad!”
“Oh yeah, very funny,” said Wyl.
The paladins moved on, still laughing at their own joke.
