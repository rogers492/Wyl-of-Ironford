Wyl wandered like this for an interminable time that seemed like years or maybe eons.  The wandering was all he came to know.  All of his past lives were expunged from his memory.  Occasionally his wanderings might happen upon a grey vista or tumbled ruin that looked momentarily familiar, but these feelings of deja vu quickly passed.


Until, one day, he found himself in an oddly familiar graveyard, where he became engulfed in a cloud of thick smoke.  Eventually, the smoke cleared to reveal a sagged and wrinkled old woman.  She was shaking as if with intense pain; skin cracked like a dried up riverbed; body crisscrossed by deep scars weeping dark, ashen puss; sunken, hollowed, bloodshot eyes filled with torment and anguish. She breathed a long, rattling, putrid breath, that stung Wyl's eyes and made him gag.


It slowly dawned on Wyl that he had a form that was no longer ghostly and that the world had colour.
The old hag cackled, "Welcome into the service of the Dark Lady."
Though Wyl's memories were still fogged, he understood straight away that the old hag had used necromantic arts to raise him into the cult of the undead.
"So recruit, you shall train as a warlock, for no matter what your previous earthly existence entailed, I sense you might have some magical ability.  Go down into the sepulchre and seek out the warlock trainer to begin your service of the Dark Lady.  No doubt the trainer will reward you with some rags better fitting than those mould ridden tatters that barely cover your ancient bones."


And so Wyl began a new cycle of lives, among the Undead.


[leveling and becoming an affliction lock]


Wyl stood stock still, looking down at his skeletal fingers and the rings that shone dully from them, in particular, the faintly fluorescent Band of Burning Servitude, while Subjugator Shi'hraz, the arch-demon in command of the Burning Legion forces in the region, ranted for over an hour.  She walked round and round the room, looking straight through Wyl whenever she looked in his direction, her six blue arms flailing in mock combat, the cold blue flames burning fiercely in her empty eye-sockets.  As usual, it was all about some minor defeat she had recently suffered in the field.  He'd heard it too many times before to boil-up inside any more.  He showed no emotion and made no comment as she railed against incompetent generals, even when she belittled his own past achievements.
At last she drew breath and continued more calmly.
“I am sure your campaign successes have brought some little repute in the provinces.  But, I have much grander dreams warlock, so what of those?”
“My lady, I have completed many quests in your service, and at last, the final task is accomplished.”
“Final task?” she laughed, derisively, “Nay.  For those that truly serve, there are further tasks to complete on each and every day.  Great honour and great rewards await the most dedicated servants.”
She handed Wyl a bundle of heavy parchment sheaves entitled 'Servant of the Ring'.  Wyl stuffed them into his quest log.
“Nonetheless, my lady, I have reached the end of the current chain.”
“So, what reward are you expecting?  A powerful trinket perhaps?”
She opened her palm to reveal a tiny golden star: An Ounce of Gratitude – Use: reflects one hundred percent of healing you receive to all party or raid members.
She snapped her hand shut and spun on her heels, “Keep trying warlock and you may earn it one day.”
Her final words fluttered like bats between the high rafters as she vanished into the war-room.


Wyl marched out of the keep and stood atop the snow covered stone steps of the main gate, between the two skeletal guards.  The teeth of the guards chattered as they tried in vain to draw comfort from the unlit brazier.
Wyl looked into the distance mumbling to himself, “How I tire of this land of the dancing dead.”
“Er?” said the guards.
Wyl spoke up, “It never seems to get any warmer, does it?  How I miss my flesh.”
The guards grunted assent.
Wyl continued, “We've already cut down every tree, so there is nothing to warm our hearths now.  But look yonder, that's the corpse of the king of the treants, the last of his kind.  I see the hangman found a use for him.”
“Bring an axe from the blacksmith, on my order!” Wyl barked at the guard nearest.
“Yes, my Lord,” said the guard as he scurried off.
“This once was a warm land, a long time ago.”
“Yes, my lord,” replied the remaining guard.
“You local?”
“No, my lord.  I think I grew up on a farm in Westfall.”
“Ah, I remember it well; gentle hills and fields of golden wheat.”
“Memories of that former life are so faded now.”
“Do you recall being raised from the dead to this sham existence?”
“Aye, m'lord. The necromancer Muzarak raised my bones from the dust of the Eastern Plaguelands.  I assume I had died there but whether plague or blade did for me I do not recall.”
“Mmm, my former life and death are dim shadows too.”
The other guard returned with a woodsman's axe.
“Good man,” said Wyl, “I'll stand your watch while you two go and cut the bough from the treant and chop logs for the brazier.”
“Yes, my lord!” they said enthusiastically.
As Wyl watched them hurry down the hill, he sensed the presence of another.  He surreptitiously slipped a vial of Cat's Eye Elixir from his pouch and took a sip.  A rogue un-stealthed a few yards away, treading carefully up the steps.
“Welcome, assassin,” Wyl said quietly.
The rogue stopped in her tracks.
“If it is I your blade hungers for, then let’s go at it; if it's the Subjugator, then she is in the keep, alone, in her war-room.”
She put her hand to her masked lips and blew Wyl a silent, theatrical kiss.   Then, she turned and tiptoed on through the gate-arch.  Wyl thought she looked familiar, something about the deep, dark eyes and the lithe grace, but the red bandanna face-mask made it difficult to place her.


As the rogue vanished into the keep, the sound of huffing and puffing drew his attention to the guards lugging the bough of the hanging-tree up the stone steps.  They lay the gnarled old bough by the brazier and took a short breather.  Then the beefier guard began chopping the bough into rough logs.  Wyl thought he heard a faint commotion within the keep, but the guards seemed not to notice.  The Band of Burning Servitude suddenly felt loose and Wyl looked down to see it had stopped glowing. The beefy guard soon had a small pile of logs and the other guard laid them in the brazier as he grinned, “There's enough wood in this bough to keep us warm for a week!”
The guard with the axe stopped chopping to mop his brow, “You should try choppin' it mate, it's warmed me up good 'n' proper.”
“Aye mate, that'll do for now, I'll chop some more later.”
Turning to Wyl, the guard said, “With your permission, my lord, I'll go collect some dry grass for kindling.”
“No need,” replied Wyl, “I have something.”
Wyl took out his quest log and flipped through the heavy parchments to the 'Servant of the Ring'.  He pulled the bundle from his quest log and handed it to the guard.
Wyl stood and watched as the guard made the quest parchments into faggots and then built-up the firewood around them.  Then Wyl pulled the Band of Burning Servitude from his finger and threaded it onto one of the dry finger-like twigs that stuck out of the bough.
“Behold!  The King of the Treants doth serve her now.”
The guards looked askance.
“Just my private joke,” said Wyl with a wink.
He cast a flame spell and the parchment caught fire immediately.
Within minutes they could feel the radiant warmth as the wood burned fiercely.
A little later, the fire settled and a shower of sparks billowed into the sky.  Wyl watched the embers dance their way to freedom.
Wyl handed out Nethergarde Ale to appreciative noises from the two guards, “A toast: may the jolly hangman hang us well!”

She moved so softly, that her feet made not a sound, nor left a ripple, as she stepped across the lake.  Her shining lips were the colour of the lifeblood of her lover.  She lay her hand upon me and this she did say, “Oh it will not be long love 'til our wedding day.”

Unbridled Passion – her face swam before him – he recalled the trinket she pressed to his palm – frees all chains – constraints – all conscience – ANNiHILATE!




He lay naked on his back, staring up into the bright grey of the gently falling rain, blinking frequently as the raindrops fell into his eyes.  First, he sensed a shadow, then her beautiful face came into view.  She smiled and he smiled back.  He tried to form a word, but could only gurgle like a newborn child.


The skin on her face rapidly aged and cracked until it looked like a riverbed to which the rains would never return, even as she wept.  He disintegrated to dust under her sorrowful gaze.  The wind swirled around and formed his dry remains into a pile.  A laughing hyena cocked its leg and urinated onto the pile.  A familiar looking giant knelt and scooped him into a huge palm, then kneaded him back into his manly shape before putting him into the forge.  But it was too hot and he cracked to become merely dust once again.  Oh what a thirst he had.


[DIES AS UNDEAD, in Grimshire can only see folk here coz near corpse, goes to look at corpse but refuses to rez]


(near Ironford?)


He spent yet another evening in the Scarlet Raven Tavern.  And once again, he drank and drank and drank.  From somewhere beyond the drunken haze, a soft female voice spoke, “Would you mind if I drank some of your leftover wine.”
For a moment he thought he recognised the voice and a tiny glimmer of hope leapt in his chest.  But then he remembered standing amongst the runed pillars of Zul'Farrak with the white sands of the Tanaris desert stinging his face.  He remembered the pile of bones by the altar there and the skeletal finger that wore the ring he had given her.  He remembered the revenge he had exacted from the denizens of that place.  Blood drinkers!  He had given them blood; blood enough to drown in. Yet even as he relived these gruesome memories they seemed to belong to someone else.  He tried to look up, but his head fell back onto his arms and his eyelids felt like lead.
She spoke again, “Why do you hang about in Grimshire?  It's such a dreary place.”
He tried to grunt but even that was beyond him.
“Surely, a powerful mage like you can do better than this?”
He thought about trying to answer, but the innkeeper said, “Who are you talking to miss?”
“Why, I'm talking to the mage sitting... he's gone!”
“Aye miss, that'll be the ghost.  The ghost of Wyl of Ironforge, some say.”
“Oh!”


Ironforge.  The name rattled around inside his skull.  He stood beside the huge anvil within the Great Forge.  Once the scene of bustling industry, where the swords and armour of mighty Ironforge had been hammered noisily into shape, it was all silent now, except for the forlorn wind that moaned incessantly.  The great vat was cold and empty of the bubbling, molten metal, that had bequeathed the city its name.  A ruined city, deserted now, but for the timid ghosts that whispered fables of a failed race.


“Argh! To whom do these drunken dreams that haunt me belong?”
He sought comfort in the ice and snow.  After an interminable wandering, he found himself looking north from atop high Frostblade Peak. Standing on the very edge of the precipice, with the ancient altar-stone behind him, he looked down to the distant ice-covered rocks far, far below.  He leant slowly forward and then fell and fell, his fluttering cloak and the rushing air the only sounds. He laughed at the world, for at last he felt free of it; yet the world still pulled him back.  After a few brief moments of exhilaration, the world caught him gently in crisp fresh snow.  He lay face down for a moment, trying to savour the memory of cool snow-melt on his skin, but the sensations eluded him.  Then he arose and stood looking north again, where pale green aurora played across the horizon.  He thought for a moment that it was a trick of the light, but no, he was sure he could see a spirit-healer flying towards him.  Within moments, the graceful apparition hovered before him on the slow, graceful beat of her spirit wings.


Wyl looked into her beautiful forgiving eyes, “I seek no resurrection,” he said quietly.
The spirit healer reached out and clasped Wyl softly to her breast.  Without another word the pair ascended high above the trees.  Wyl did not resist; he felt a great comforting of the heart in that divine embrace.  The grey earth sped by beneath them, league upon league, day upon day and night upon night, until at last the spirit healer descended and laid Wyl tenderly upon the earth.


As the spirit healer released Wyl from her soothing embrace, his soul sickness left him too and memories of his former life returned with a jolt.
He looked into the face of the graceful spirit healer, “Suzze!”
He suddenly saw where he was, in the citadel graveyard. He stood as a shadowy ghost, bathed in the glowing light of the spirit-healer, the terrible cold of death permeating every fibre of his being. Yet the pain was sweetened by the deep yearning for eternal peace. He knew he could choose now, to cease forever the torment of his corporeal existence. The spirit-healer hovered silently above him, awaiting patiently the answer to her unspoken question; life or afterlife?  All his past lives in this sphere called to him, as did the lives yet to be. But how shallow all his devious schemes and worldly aspirations seemed in that moment too. But something else also called to him, some vestige of his spirit that cried out for rebirth, some fervent conviction that his time here was not yet run.  There were people... who needed him.  He fought himself within himself; improbable hope against predictable disappointment.
Slowly, he stretched his arms out to the graceful spirit floating above him, as the bittersweet longing forced an anguished cry from his ghostly lips, "Resurrection!"


His body was racked with terrible agonies as the spirit healer channelled her living essence into him. He sensed the solidity of his body return as he dropped to his knees gasping. As the hurting waned, to become the more bearable aching of resurrection sickness, he smelled the earth and the grass and felt the lesser chill of a natural wind.
