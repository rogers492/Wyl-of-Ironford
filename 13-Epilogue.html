<p class="intro">


Wyl wandered aimlessly around the courtyard, where the goblins, always quick to spot a business opportunity, had already set out their stalls.  Then he noticed the rogue stood by the ornate central fountain.  He admired her black-leather feminine silhouette for a few moments before  he walked up behind her and said hello.
As she turned, he noticed tiny tears in the corners of her eyes.
“What's the matter?” he said, as quietly as he could above the market hubbub.
“Don't worry about me,” she shrugged, “I'll cope;  I always do.”









Truly Naked Ball


Meet by fountain.


"Are you really sure you want to take a thief to the ball?"
"Well, I was kinda hoping you would steal my heart."


They approached the door to the great hall, where waiters stood with trays of drinks.  One of the waiters, clearly some gnomish robotic device, clanked and buzzed as he addressed them cheerily, "Good evening, one and all.  His majesty humbly requests that you accept this free drink upon entry, to the Truly Naked Ball."
"Aha!" said Wyl, "I finally get to see your face!"
"Well, just make sure you keep your gaze up at that level!" said the rogue, though the twinkle in her dark eyes hinted that she may not mean it.  They each took a shot glass from the tray and knocked them back in one.  There was a brief hissing as they became obscured in a cloud of violet vapour.  Wyl watched intently for the face of the rogue to appear as the vapour gradually dissipated.  But as the cloud evaporated, they both burst into laughter; they had both been transformed into skeletons, stripped of all flesh except their eyeballs.
"Darn it! I've been cheated!" Wyl laughed.
"My secret is safe," laughed the rogue.
"I must say though, you have wonderful bone structure," said Wyl, as he took the rogue by the hand and escorted her, giggling, into the Great Hall.
They stopped at the top of the steps to look down upon the revellers already inside; they were all skeletons, all truly naked.  Laughing, they skipped down the staircase and joined the throng.  The chamber was awash with a wonderful warming light and they felt buoyed amongst the glittering, magical chandeliers, that floated like soap bubbles, beneath a soft rain of twinkling stardust.  Happily, they danced together, and, gazing deep into each others eyes, the crowd became just a hazy backdrop.
Wyl held her close and whispered breathlessly, “That roguish hardness is gone from your eyes tonight; perhaps it's the light.”
She whispered back softly, “Perhaps it's the company; I feel... aglow.”
“Oh you are.  Me too; this skeleton grin shows exactly how I feel.”
“Can skeletons kiss?”
Wyl held her tight and lowered his mouth to hers, but their teeth grated on each other's and they burst into laughter.
“Perhaps it's for the best,” she whispered, “otherworldly adventurers shouldn't go falling in love.”
“Not even just for one night?”
“We can dance the dance.”
“Then dear lady, let's dance until our hearts are full.”
“Yes let's,” she giggled.
They spun majestically across the floor, stirring a swirling fractal of graceful whorls within the cloud of sparkling dust, and mingled with the radiant throng of dancing bones and grinning skulls.




Tongues cursing each other in jar




"I want you to use all of that stone over there to build a shrine to Queen Suzze."
"Och! That will be a very expensive job.  Shall we discuss payment, your majesty?"
"Certainly goblin.  In exchange for a beautiful statue, in honour of the Queen, I will instruct my tailor not to make you into a pair of fluffy dice for the horns of my war mammoth!" bellowed the King.
"That is certainly a very generous offer, your majesty.  I'll get right on it," said the goblin, bowing obsequiously as he backed out through the door.
"Ah, there you are Wyl.  I have an errand in need of a fine fellow."
"Indeed, your majesty?  Would this errand be dangerous?"
The King laughed loudly and patted Wyl hard on the back, "It is a mere trifle for a hero such as you."
"And where will this errand take me, your majesty?"
"Further west, into uncharted territory.  That's why I need someone with wit and courage to undertake it."
"Wit and courage?"
"Don't be modest Wyl, you have plenty of both.  Oh alright, I need someone who doesn't look like a walking anatomy lesson for this mission."
"Well, I suppose my mother's cooking can wait a little longer."
"Good gnome! Now then, we have discovered documents that suggest the Arcanist had a powerful enemy to the west.  Any enemy of the Arcanist is a friend of ours, but I need a diplomat to locate these new friends and introduce us.  I don't want to scare them, so I thought you would be ideal for the task.  We know very little about this race to the west, so there is some danger, I'm afraid."
"I think I'm getting used to danger."
"That's the spirit.  Now go find the chief scribe and tell him to give you my letters of introduction and the translation glyph.  Then get provisions from the quartermaster.  He has a few interesting little trinkets the Arcanist has no further use for too.  Just take your pick and leave whenever you are ready."
"Thank you, your majesty."
The King swallowed Wyl up in a huge hug and spoke warmly, "Take care young fellow, you and I have much feasting and drinking to do over tall tales, before the spirit-healer takes us for keeps."
"Thank you, your majesty.  I will be careful."
"Now, be on your way, I have a kingdom to build!"
"Aye, farewell."
As the king turned back towards the heap of stone, his pleasant aspect fell away and his broad shoulders sagged.  Even with his back to him, the King sensed Wyl was still there.
He sighed, "It's not for me, my fine friend.  It's for her.  Everything I do, from this day on, I will do her way, with friendship and healing, much as these war-bitten fists are unaccustomed to such subtleties."
"Aye, your majesty."
"You were there with her, at the last?"
"Yes.  She lamented your parting and..."
"I remember clearly the day we first met.  Cocky and carefree I was back then, barely a sergeant, just another foot-slogger really. Her gaze stopped me in my tracks.  I've spent the rest of my days since trying to be worthy of that look.  And yet, she gave it to me freely, every time I looked to her.   She never asked me to earn it."
"She told me to tell your grand-daughter that your love meant more to her than all of her epic deeds."
The King bowed his head for a moment, then said, "And her love meant more to me than any kingdom, yet that is what I am left with.  I shall rebuild it in her name.  Indeed, it shall bear her name.  Henceforth, it shall be known as the kingdom of Suzze."
The King turned to face Wyl, "Once you have completed your business with the chief scribe, tell him to come find me; he has a proclamation to write!"
"Yes, your majesty!"
The King began to look lost in sadness again, then he pulled himself together and ordered, "Get going, Emissary of Suzze!"
Wyl bowed and left.


By mid afternoon, Wyl was following a rough road across wide open grassland.   As he rode up to a fork in the road, he saw a familiar figure, stood contemplating the choice of routes.
"Am I ever going to see what lies behind that mask of yours?" Wyl called out as he approached the rogue.
"I doubt it," said the rogue as she mounted up.
"Pity.  I'm heading west, on an errand for the King.  I really would appreciate some company."
"Still running errands?" said the rogue with a cheeky giggle.
"What is that trinket you keep so close?"
She fingered the small glass vial that hung from a heavy gold chain around her neck, "That tiny drop of fluid... is a single tear. Shed by a man whom I loved and who loved me. He sent it to me when he finally realised that we would never be together again. It is not his sadness, he would never send me that. It's a tear of pure everlasting love. Even after all this time, it has not evaporated."
"Is love truly everlasting?  Remove the stopper from the vial and let's see."
She thought for a moment, then she pulled out the stopper.  Within moments, the tear had dried up and was gone without trace.
Looking deep into her eyes, he whispered softly, "All we have is now."
She snapped the vial from the chain and tossed it away as she spun her mount around alongside his, "You have a special jar too; I suppose you do still have it?"
Wyl pulled the jar from his pack and held it up, "It's the whole reason I came to be here.  Perhaps my whole destiny has been set by what's in this jar.  These two tongues cursed each other with such eternal hate that they became more vitriolic than the acid spit of a rock-wyrm."
"Is hate truly eternal?  Remove the lid from the jar and let's see."
Wyl thought for a moment, then he popped off the lid and poured away the containing potion.
The Tongue of the Undying Warlock began to wriggle, but, instead of uttering a baleful curse, it recited:
The woman is a ripe fruit,
Uneaten, she will but perish.
Devour her you brute!
All her sweet juices, relish.


“At last, we agree on something!” cried the Tongue of the Undying Enchantress:
The heartless and the cruel
Fought for her beating jewel,
But love's passion is the fuel
To bring her sweet renewal.


Wyl dropped the jar, then leant over to the rogue and pulled her mask up over her eyes.
Giggling she said, "What are you doing, silly?"
Wyl whispered softly, "For once, just go with your heart."
Then he kissed her passionately on the lips.  Though slightly startled at first, she soon yielded and with softening lips, kissed him back.  The kiss lingered breathlessly for several moments until their lips slowly parted.  The rogue removed her mask and shivered.
“Are you cold?” asked Wyl.
“No, terrified,” she replied.
“Terrified of what?”
“Happiness,” she said, as she looked warmly into his eyes.
Wyl reached out and squeezed her hand.
"Let's race!" she said.
"West," said Wyl.
On her nod, they both grinned and spurred their mounts to a gallop alongside each other.   The hooves of their beasts thundered upon the heavy earth as they sped across flowing plains of tall grass, with the cooling breeze feeling fresh on their faces. A small shared happiness sprung from within them.
"Ha ha!" Wyl shouted into the wind, "We're not dead! Not yet! Yeee har!"
He whooped and hollered and shouted with defiance, "Life; bring it on!"
In a single flowing movement, the rogue dismissed her mount and leapt onto the back of Wyl's galloping beast.  He felt her arms circle tight around his waist and her head press against his back.
"Love," she laughed, "bring it on!"


  And their arcane gods smiled down upon them, at least for now.
