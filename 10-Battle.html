<p class="intro">
The new dawn arrived slowly.  The deep purple sky, with its panoply of twinkling stars, turned violet, as the first morning rays stretched from beyond the horizon to bestow their warmth.  As the rim of the sun itself appeared, the King shouted his orders, which were spread throughout the entire host by each unit commander in turn. As the sun rose, the army appeared from the gloom, in well organized lines and groups.  The front rank then responded in unison to the first order; they turned their polished shields on-mass, to reflect the first rays of the sun at the Black Citadel.
The King held his sword high and shouted, “For the Light!”
The shout was repeated as a mighty roar by the assembled host.  Then all was suddenly quiet again, save for the fluttering of banners and the occasional snorting stallion.
“Onward!” shouted the King, as he spurred his war mammoth forward.
The kettle-drums struck up the beat of the march and the vast army moved slowly forward in formation.


Wyl watched the steady progress of the host for a few moments, until he heard a familiar voice calling to him from behind.  He turned to see three Draenei approaching.
“Good morning, Wyl,” said Krendal.
“Let's hope so,” Wyl replied.
“Indeed.  Please welcome Grend the paladin and Psiglo the healer, they will be joining our party.”
“Greetings,” said Wyl as the two Draenei gave their traditional formal salute.
“So, let's collect our other party member and then get in position,” said Krendal as he mounted-up.
Once they were all mounted, Krendal led the way down the sandy slope and onto the eastern flank of the marching army, where they galloped through a crowd of toiling sappers and their siege engines, until Krendal pulled up at a supply depot that was busy with frantic activity.
A ruddy-faced, grey-bearded dwarf waved at Krendal and shouted, “Be with you in a mo' mate!”
Wyl and the three Draenei dismounted and stood waiting while the dwarf barked orders at a group of engineers.  After a minute or two, the dwarf walked over to Wyl and looked him up and down.
“So, you must be the secret weapon then!”
Wyl looked nonplussed.
The dwarf slapped Wyl on the back and laughed, “Cheer up lad, it'll be free beer for life if we pull this off!”
Nodding in the direction of the three Draenei, he continued with a broad grin, “Let's show these Outlanders what the men of Ironforge are made of.  They call me Boomer Brunner, an' I is pleased to make your acquaintance.”
“Thanks, I'm Wyl.  Pleased to meet you too.”
“Well, then, let's get busy while our powder is dry!” said Boomer as he mounted up.
Once they were all mounted, Boomer led the way out of the depot.  The clamour of the army was soon far behind them as they headed into the hills to the east of the citadel.
Not long into the hills they were greeted by another dwarf, who suddenly appeared from behind a large boulder, brandishing a heavy blunderbuss.
“Hey Boomer!”
“Hey mate!  How's it going?”
“We got the mine open, couple o' sticks did it.  The lads went in to pave the way, just follow the  torches.”
“That's great!”
Before much longer, they were at the mine entrance, an unnatural cave in the hillside.  Fragments of the boulders that had sealed the mine were scattered about the entrance. Another sentry greeted Boomer then vanished once again amongst the rubble.  They dismounted and entered.  Flaming torches marked their way as they walked carefully into the gloom.  To their annoyance, the three Draenei had to stoop awkwardly.  Boomer chuckled and led on.  Here and there, they passed over the fresh corpses of giant cave bats.
“Keep your eyes peeled, the lads might miss some...”
Even before he had finished his sentence, Boomer was interrupted by  the bright flash and loud clang of Grend's Hammer of Justice hitting a startled bat on the head.
“Awesome,” growled the paladin.
Excitement over, they trod on in the flickering gloom.  The tunnel wound on and down, deeper and deeper into the hillside.
They had been stumbling after the dwarf for about another twenty minutes, when he whispered loudly, “Halt!”
They all froze in mid-stride.


A few yards ahead, a torch spluttered alight to reveal a pair of steely eyes and a toothless grimace.  Grend stepped up beside the dwarf and raised his massive two-handed hammer.
“Steady lad,” laughed Boomer, “It's McTavish.  For better or worse, he's on our side.”
“Ach, Boomer, yer bloody layabout, what took yer so long?” joked McTavish.
“Who'd rush to see thee ugly mush!”
“He he, lotsa lassies would,” winked McTavish.
“Well, are we all primed?”
“Aye, just about, here's the master fuse,” said McTavish as he waved the torch to his right to reveal the coiled end of a fuse on the rough rock floor.
Just then two more dwarves appeared behind McTavish, who turned to address them, “All done?”
“All done,” said the one with the fiery red beard.
“Aye, all done,” said the other one, who looked identical with an identical fiery red beard.
McTavish turned back to Boomer, “We're all done.”
Boomer turned to Grend, “We're all done,” he said.
Grend turned to Krendal.
“Yeah,” said Krendal before Grend could speak, “I get it, we're all done.”
Grend chuckled, “Awesome.”
“I'll do the honours,” said McTavish.
“Everyone else back up the tunnel a bit,” ushered Boomer, “It's gonna be loud!”
They stumbled back in the gloom, until they rounded the next bend.  Boomer and the two fiery bearded dwarves sat in a line with their backs to the wall, put their fingers in their ears and screwed their eyes tight-shut.  The three Dranei looked at them and then at each other before they also sat in a line against the wall opposite, with their fingers in their ears and their eyes tight-shut.
Oh what a picture, thought Wyl.
He sat down between the line of Dranei on the one side and dwarves on the other, put his fingers in his ears and screwed tight-shut his eyes. Within a moment, there was a loud boom and the cave shook as dust and small pebbles rained down on them.  A moment later, a choking, sooty cloud passed around the bend in the tunnel and over them.  Wyl held his breath as the stench of burnt gunpowder filled his nostrils, but a strong breeze sprang up and the air soon cleared.
“Let's go!” shouted Boomer.
They all sprang to their feet and dusted themselves off.  Krendal and Grend, mighty sword and hammer drawn, strode side by side, closely followed by Psiglo, then the dwarves and finally Wyl.  They rounded the bend to see a warm light at the end of the tunnel.  As they strode in formation, they could eventually make out the silhouette of McTavish back-lit within the jagged circular hole the dynamite had wrought.  He was looking out onto the scene beyond the blast-hole; all Wyl could make of it were seething clouds that appeared lit by some great raging fire. They continued on but the floor was strewn with larger rubble that made the going more difficult and slower.  The frequent curses in various dialects were testimony to the fact that Wyl wasn't the only one stubbing toes and turning ankles.  They were close to McTavish now and could hear  a great strange sounding wind.  A little further on, Wyl thought the clouds had resolved into a swirling flock of birds or perhaps insects and the strange wind into the whoosh of their motion through the air and the beat of millions of tiny wings.
McTavish half-turned towards them and pointed down, shouting, “There's a ledge!”
Suddenly, a swift shadow of wing and claw flashed past the hole and took McTavish with it.
“McTavish!” shouted Boomer with a cry that began as reprimand and ended in grief.
Psiglo, strode forward a few paces, “We need to recce the ledge. Krendal, you get out there and take a look.  Mage, freeze him to the ledge, we don't want to lose another.”
The Draenei healer dropped a clutch of totems as Krendal stepped out.  Wyl cast Frost at his feet while Grend stood just behind Krendal with hammer raised.
“Incoming!” shouted Krendal.
A swift clawed creature flew into him but he batted it towards Grend with his shield, who smashed it flat into the cave floor with a single thunderous blow.  Krendal looked around and had to direct  two more winged attackers beneath Grend's mighty hammer-blows before the Frost melted and he stepped back into the tunnel.
“It's a huge cylindrical cave stretching up and down into the mists. There is a strange pulsating portal of fire below and a portal of green fel fire above.  There is a great swarm of those winged horrors circling between the two portals.  As McTavish said, there is a ledge, spiralling around the cave wall, but out there we would be at the mercy of the winged horrors.  It's not obvious where it leads down to, but a few hundred yards up there is some sort of pillared temple carved into the rock-face.”
“That should be close enough.” said Wyl, “But I will need time to invoke the spell.”
“Aye lad, what spell would that be then?” said Boomer.
“The spell to close the nether portal, I think,” Wyl replied.
“Yer think? Dun yer ken why we 'ere lad?”
Wyl pulled the Ouroboros of Benzol and the jar containing the wriggling tongues from his backpack.
“It's slowly dawning on me.  It's something to do with these and the portals.  I don't know if anyone is sure this will work, but there's a chance we can prevent Zarqoma calling through his demonic allies, perhaps seal the portal forever and end his terrible reign.”
“Ooer, successful or not it doesnay sound like the sorta fight we'll all walk away from.”
Krendal lay one hand on Wyl's shoulder, “We three Draenei have sworn to help you accomplish your mission, no matter what it costs us, although we'll try to get us all out of here alive if we can.”
Krendal turned to Boomer, “You and your boys have done your bit, so don't feel you have to get into this fight.  At least one of you should report back whether we succeed or not.”
“Och, the King'll figure it out fer 'imself.  We're in!”
“Awesome.” said Grend, raising his hammer in salute.
“Okay,” said Psiglo, “But how do we buy enough time for the spell?  How much time do you need?”
"Sorry," said Wyl, "I really have no idea."
"Ok, first things first," said Psiglo, "Let's figure out how we get up to the temple, we may see better from up there."
"I don't fancy our chances out on this ledge," said Krendal, "if the swarm decends I won't be able to shield us all."
"We need a distraction," said Boomer, "Got any dynamite left lads?"
"No dynamite," said the first twin.
"But we do have a keg o' gunpowder each," grinned the second twin.
"Now that's my kinda distraction!" bellowed Boomer.
The twins laughed loudly, if a little nervously.
"Right lads, build a dwarven fishing pole.  Here, use this rope an’ get sharp!"


Wyl and the Draenei watched as the twins each tied one end of a long rope to their keg and then tied the other ends to a massive boulder amongst the rubble.  Boomer helped them position the kegs in the blast hole and afix fuses.


Boomer turned to Wyl and the Draenei, "Righto, the twins'll push the kegs down the ledge and we'll hope they pull a good catch while we make a dash up to the temple."
"Awesome," said Grend as he raised his hammer in salute.
"Right, let's do it!" shouted Krendal, "Grend, you behind me, then Wyl, then Boomer, then Psiglo in the rear."
"Good luck laddies," Boomer said to the twins, "Let the king know we gave it our best shot."
The twins stood ready to kick the kegs out onto the ledge as Boomer lit the fuses.
"Ready, steady, go!" shouted Boomer.
The twins kicked the kegs through the blast hole.  One tumbled over the edge and fell out of site while the other rumbled down the rocky ledge.  The swirling swarm reacted immediately as one and the greater mass of it spiralled down towards the falling kegs.
"Go! Go! Go!" shouted Krendal, "Mind the rope!"
They leapt out onto the ledge in the designated order.  Psiglo dropped a couple of totems as distractions of his own and they all ran pell mell up the rough path towards the temple columns.
The distraction worked well.  For the first half of the steep hundred yard dash they were untroubled by the swarm and only a couple of stragglers attempted to intercept them.  The Krendal and Grend tag team dealt with them with ruthless efficiency.  Wyl was just beginning to feel breathless when the rough path became a broader marble staircase and the going got easier.  Then he heard a boom from below which gave him an extra spurt of adrenaline and helped him catch up with Grend, who had been leaving him behind.  A second boom followed a few seconds later.  No one stopped to look back.


Then the chamber rocked again to an even greater booming, the sound of a thunderous deep voice, rough with gravel the size of boulders, "Who calls the Great Old Ones from their eternal dreaming?"


"Oh bugger," puffed Boomer without breaking stride, "We woke somebody up."


"Never mind that! We're in for a warm reception!" Krendal shouted urgently, gesturing towards a crowd of guards forming up in the temple entrance.


As they rushed up the marble staircase, two heavily armoured, spear brandishing Guardians of Zarqoma barred their way.  Krendal unleashed his battle cry and crashed shield first straight through them, splintering both spear shafts.  Before the guards could respond Krendal smashed one on top of the head with the hilt of his broadsword and Grend stunned the other with his Hammer of Justice then finished him with a hammer blow to the head.


Four more guards rushed up but the first ran onto Krendal's Shield Smash and was knocked clean-out.  Krendal Taunted the other three, who formed a semicircle around him and all simultaneously thrust their spears.  Krendal dodged inside the leftmost spear while sweeping away to the right the thrusts of the other two with his sword.  Grend flew through the air with his hammer held high behind his head and smashed it through the skull of the guard on the right.  Krendal rammed his sword back left into the throat of the guard on that side.  Grend swung his hammer in a massive jaw breaking uppercut that flung the last guard backwards several yards.


They all ran between the pillars and into the temple.


A large slowly spinning red crystal, fizzing with arcane energies was suspended in mid air above a central altar, ringed by Acolytes of Zarqoma who were all focusing their arcane emanations towards the crystal in some diabolical ritual.


Grend immediately cast Consecration, covering the floor of the chamber in glowing runes of holy light.  The Acolytes all shuddered and wailed as they broke painfully from their ritual.


The Arch Acolyte pointed a wizened finger and cried balefully, “Cast out the desecrators!”
“Awesome!”, shouted Grend with relish as he dropped Hammer of Justice onto the Arch Acolyte's head and smashed him down with a mighty hammer blow.


The Acolytes had gathered their wits and several were conjuring their necromantic familiars.


Boomer slapped Wyl on the back, “Better be about yer business me lad, while we keep this lot busy!”


“What the hell am I supposed to do?”, he cried in frustrated anger.
“Buggered if I know laddie, but do summin quick!”


Meanwhile, the Acolytes had conjured their phalanx of Bone Warriors.  Krendal taunted them and they began to surround him but Boomer ran up between Krendal and Grend.
“Duck! And watch out for splinters!”, he shouted as he unleashed his blunderbuss into the throng of Bone Warriors.  Krendal dived left and Grend dived right, hitting the ground just as the bone shrapnel exploded everywhere.  For a few moments friend and foe alike were blinded by the sulphurus smoke cloud. But when it cleared, only the the front rank of the Bone Warriors had taken the full force of the blast; the rest began charging.


Krendal leapt to his feet with a furious battle-cry and decapitated the first Bone Warrior with a quick swing of his sword while bashing another with his shield. Grend flew through the air to deliver another mighty hammer smash that splintered more bones as Boomer blasted away at the Acolytes with his pistols.  The main cohort of Bone Warriors smashed into Krendal and Grend, raining down many more blows than the heroic Dranei could fend or block.  Psiglo cast Earth-Shield on Krendal and a spinning ball of rock began rapidly orbiting the mighty tank, absorbing blow after blow from the Bone Warriors.  Psiglo dropped a Healing-Stream totem that pulsed life back into his allies, gently healing wounds and reinvigorating tired muscles.


Wyl was about to assist by raining down fire on the Bone Warriors when he noticed a sudden increase in brightness of the acrid green glow coming from behind him.  He spun around to see the sorcerer Zarqoma floating down on demon wings of fel flame and alighting at the top of the marble staircase.  He was flanked by two demons of fire and brimstone who turned the marble to lava where they stepped.


Zarqoma laughed with mighty disdain, "Pathetic fool!  Do you really think you can unravel the mystery of the curse?  What do you know of death and dying, much less of the undying?  Perhaps I should teach you of these things?  Yes, that would be a fitting punishment indeed, to have you realise just how lowly you are, to have the knowledge, but not the power to use it.  But how?  It would take a whole other lifetime, much less privileged, for you to truly understand the meaning of these things."


Wyl began casting, but Zarqoma silenced and debilitated him with a brief mumbled whisper.


Zarqoma laughed again, "Aha! I have it.  You will learn of all these things and you will despair with the knowing.


Wyl could see Zarqoma conjuring, but he was powerless to break free.  His felt his life drip away slowly, as if Zarqoma was needlessly spinning it out for his own amusement.  Wyl's last thoughts were concerns for his comrades in the temple, the army relying on him, the king, Eweline, his family, his lost love. There was no pain, only a mounting regret.


When death came, it was not quite like all his previous deaths.  True, he was suddenly wrenched from the scene of his demise and he was a ghost in an unfamiliar graveyard.  But there was no spirit healer to offer resurrection.  There was no indication of where his corpse lie.  He was a lost spirit in a strange limbo.
