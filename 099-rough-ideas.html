Changeling: boyhood duel - explains why a human grew up near Ironforge



<br />A promise of everlasting love - drops (loot), but you realise it is worthless

<br />You don’t remember that, do you? You always forget your sins, but remember everyone else’s.  That’s why you think you’re innocent while everyone else is guilty.


<br />dedication: for the little men in our lives.  One day, they will stand tall.

<br />And for every drop of dripping hate that splashes from her lips, another drop of lifeblood is squeezed from the crying heart of her lover


<br />Twist of fate
<br />umbilical


<br />Having assembled the rocks into a rough human shape, he conjured with a flourish as he cried out loud, “Figure of earth, know thyself.”


<br />She does not understand, as her spirit soars, that the dark stain upon her hands, is the life-blood of her lover.
