        <h1 class="chapterHeading">RUM CURIO</h1>

    <p class="intro">

Once there, he clambered up some loose rigging onto the slightly inclined main deck, then sat on the gunwale to catch his breath.
The whole landscape was rapidly filling with water; small skiffs and dinghies were already floating about.
Wyl was just beginning to realise he wouldn't be able to sail the frigate single-handed, when his thoughts were rudely interrupted by a loud coarse yelling.
<br/>"Avast there, ye landlubber!  What ye doin' aboard me vessel, all uninvited like?"
<br/>Wyl stood speechless, looking at the scruffy bearded pirate with a cutlass in one hand and a rum bottle in the other.
<br/>"Speak up!  Hic!  It's the brig for thee, if ye cannot show just cause why ye be aboard!" shouted the pirate, swaying unsteadily and waving the cutlass at Wyl's throat.
<br/>"I... brought you the sea!" Wyl bluffed, as loudly as the pirate.
<br/>The drunken pirate blinked and staggered over to the gunwale.  He lifted his cap and stroked his shiny pate, "The sea!  Well I'll swear by the gods o' the Naga, ye brought the sea!"
<br/>He turned to Wyl with tears of deep gratitude filling his eyes, then looked again at the rising waters.
<br/>With a huge grin he spun around and did a whirling drunken jig up the tilted deck, singing loudly:

<blockquote>
<p>
If I had the heart and wings
<br/>Of the pure and noble gryphon,
<br/>I'd carry her away with me;
<br/>My love amongst the Elven,
<br/>With her olive skinned breasts
<br/>And hair as black as the raven.
</p>
<p>
With happiness she'd mount me,
<br/>As I would be happily ridden;
<br/>Across the whole world we'd fly,
<br/>To my mountain eyrie haven,
<br/>Where we would build our nest,
<br/>To be resurrected and forgiven.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Suddenly, a nearby deck-hatch flew open with a crash and a very irate pirate wench marched across the deck and tipped a large pan of clam chowder over the pirates head
<br/>"I'll give yer 'elven love', yer chuffin' swine!" she shouted.
<br/>She turned to glare at Wyl, her eyes of emerald fire and hair of golden flame animated wildly even in the windless air.
<br/>Her look softened and she gave Wyl a secret wink before she stormed back below decks, slamming the hatch as she went.
<br/>"Well aren't we bloody alright," said the dripping pirate as clam meat and seaweed slipped down his face.
</p>
<p>
The ship suddenly lurched upright with a horrendous creaking as the rising water floated her off the sand.  The pirate fell hard on his backside and roared with laughter.
<br/>Then he struggled to his feet and swayed as the ship pitched about, "Bah, me old sea legs is grown wobbly in this confounded dessert!"
<br/>"Well, you are as pissed as a f..."
<br/>"I'll 'ave ye keep a civil tongue when thee addressin' the cap'n!  Three sheets to the wind, if ye don't mind."
<br/>"Aye, aye, cap'n!"
<br/>"That's better, shipmate.  Now, let's put some wind in us sails!"
<br/>Wyl looked up to see the masts bore little more than a few tattered shreds, "Wind?  Don't we need actual sails?"
<br/>"Aharrgh, young lad, I'll 'ave 'er sailin' faster 'an the wind.  Thee just see'f I don't, or my name ain't Cap'n 'Typhoon' Morgan!"
</p>

<p>
The pirate ran to the foot of the mainmast, took a black flag from the nearby locker and began to hoist it high.
It dangled limp in the dry windless air.  Still, the captain pulled and pulled on the rope until the flag hung lifeless from the top of the mast.
He cleated the rope and then staggered across the deck and up the steps to the poop-deck.
He slipped his cutlass into his waistband, but kept tight hold of his rum bottle.
With his free hand he took hold of the ship's wheel and looked up at the flag.
He tipped his head right back and guzzled several gulps of rum, before imparting a long, deep, rumbling belch.
<br/>Then he yelled, "All hands on the wheel!  She's gonna blow!"

<p>
Wyl took another look at the motionless flag, but decided he better humour the old sot.
He went to stand beside the captain and held the wheel.  Even as he took his stand, he felt a breath of wind.
<br/>"'Ere matey, 'ave a few swigs o' Everlast Rum.  Get drunk and it makes yer immortal!"
<br/>"Immortal, really?"
<br/>"Aye lad, so long as yer stay at least two sheets, I reckon.  I sure ain't dead yet 'n' I sure does feel immortal.
I lost count o' the years I been a suppin' from this bottle.  Though maybe I won't feel like livin' for ever, if I 'ave to suffer the 'angover!" he roared with laughter.
<br/>Then he took another long swig before offering the bottle to Wyl.  Wyl took a small drink and his throat burned.
<br/>"Whoa... that's... a kicker," he spluttered as he offered the bottle back.
<br/>"Nay lad, get it down ye,  storm's a brewin'!"
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly Wyl took a couple more swigs, which to his relief weren't quite as bad as the first.
As he forced down the last, he saw the flag flutter and then lift.
It bore a white skull and two crossed rum bottles on a black field.
He handed the bottle back to the captain while watching the flag stiffen in the freshening breeze.
To his amazement, the ship began to move, even without sails!
<br/>"How can we be moving?"
<br/>"Well," began the pirate in a conspiratorial whisper, "it's all on account o' a galleon we plundered, on the South Seas.
Back in the day, there was rich pickin's in them there waters.  Runnin' low 'n' slow she was, wi' so much gold aboard.
Aye lad, we wenched 'n' feasted for months in Booty Bay, on the strength o' that one prize.
Well, we'd fed most o' the crew to the fishes, but for one big surly lookin' orc.
A fright to behold 'e was, wi' scars all over an' tattoos on 'is teeth, I swear!
The first mate took aim at 'is ugly 'ead, wi' 'is trusty pistol.
We all saw the flash an' the smoke, an' heard the crack an' whistle o' the shot leave the muzzle.
He missed!  From five yards!  Yet the orc hadn't flinched.
The first mate reloaded twice more an' fired twice more, the last from point blank, but the orc was unmoved an' unmarked!
Well, we wus all sayin' our prayers, but no man were for givin' up the booty.
So, we binds the orc up tight an' set sail for a quiet bay where we could offload.
But within two bells, the first mate fell out o' the crows nest an' lay dead broke on the deck.
An' we wus stuck dead in the doldrums to-boot.  We's all afeared the orc's cursed us.  But what to do?
Well bless me if the orc don't just sit up an' call on some orcish shaman magic.
The first mate rises up, looking a bit bent, but alive again.  Then the orc lays down some totem an' calls the spirit o' the wind.
We then sails at six knots, wi' the sea like a mill pond around us, 'til we reaches airier climes and the natural wind fills our sails.
Well, some o' the crew still wanted rid, an'  are gettin' skittery like, wi' night comin' on an' all.
We's at the bay by sundown, so I sits wi' the orc, an' even without a common lingo, we manages to do a deal; gold talks!
Then the shaman just leaves, 'ee don't need no boat see, 'e jus' walks atop the waves, an' disappears into the darkness.
I takes the totem, an' nails it outta sight under the prow, so as it don't scare the crew like.
An' I 'as the secret, in me 'ead.  Since that day, the Rum Curio don't need no sails; just the sea beneath 'er."
</p>
<p>
Then the captain looked around, as if to make sure no one else was listening.  He took a hard swig on the rum bottle, "Trouble is, I sometimes overdo it."
<br/>"Overdo it?"
<br/>"Aye matey.  That belch was a tad longer than I was intendin', so we're gonna get a lot o' wind."
<br/>"Oh no."
<br/>"Aye, ye'll soon see why me shipmates called me, 'Typhoon'!"
<br/>"Oh yeah, whatever happened to your shipmates?"
<br/>"Quick, fetch that rope!" shouted the captain, pointing astern.
<br/>Sure enough, Wyl felt a stiff cooling breeze on his back and the ship began to make headway.
As he turned around and ran for the rope he was astonished to see a dark cloud following in their wake.  It was swirling and billowing rapidly and even as he watched a water-spout formed beneath it.
The wind grew steadily stronger as the cloud mushroomed upward, high into the sky.
Lightning flickered within the cloud and a second later, deep thunder rumbled.
The wind was whipping up white horses on the sea and the ship began to pitch from side to side as Wyl staggered back to the wheel.
A squall front formed ahead of the cloud which was speedily filling the sky above them.  The sky grew darker until suddenly, a chill rain lashed across the deck.
The ship was heaving now and the thunder and lightning was almost continuous.
Wyl and the Captain hung onto the wheel as the ship suddenly lurched forward so fast, it almost swept them off their feet.
Soon, the force of the wind was such that it threatened to blow them overboard.
The rain fell in sheets and the visibility dropped to just a few yards.  The waves were coming over the prow now and the decks were awash.
Wyl felt the Captain tie him to the wheel with the rope and turned to look into his sodden, toothless grin.
He was relishing this! He mouthed his thanks; shouting seemed pointless in the din of the storm.
The prow of the ship suddenly rose into a wave that looked like a fifty-foot wall of water ahead of them.
Wyl felt sure the ship would turn-turtle, but the Rum Curio ploughed down through the huge wave, storm lashed but proud.
</p>
<p>
At that moment, the hatch crashed open and the Captain's sea-wife reappeared, waving a large iron pan.
Despite the wild pitching of the deck, she determinedly made her way to the starboard ladder to the poop deck.
<br/>The Captain looked at Wyl and rolled his eyes upwards, then leaned into his ear and shouted, "Oops, forgot to warn the missus!""
<br/>Then he scurried down the ladder opposite to the one his sea-wife was ascending and quickly climbed the port ratlines up to the crows-nest.
His sea-wife gave chase, still waving the pan threateningly.
Though the storm still raged, Wyl was more worried about what the sea-wife would do to the Captain, if she caught him.
As she neared the crow’s nest, the Captain shimmied down the starboard ratlines and ran to the foredeck.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, a ray of sunshine cut through the mist and spray, bathing the deck in a golden glow.
The wind dropped rapidly and the storm abated.  The rain became just a few spots and a rainbow formed over the vessel.
Wyl heaved a sigh of relief.  The Captain disappeared into the forecastle and his sea-wife followed in hot pursuit.
</p>
<p>
The cloud and the rainbow very quickly evaporated, to leave crystal clear blue sky once again.
Wyl untied himself and shook the water off as best he could.
There was still a stiff breeze, presumably supernatural, so the Rum Curio was still making good, without canvas aloft.
The sea spray was now clearing to reveal a gently rippling sea and, jagged rocks ahead!
</p>
<p>
Wyl ran forward into the forecastle to find the Captain, hoping he hadn't been bashed unconscious.
He found the Captain and his sea-wife embracing each other and kissing passionately.
The iron pan lay discarded by their feet.  When their hands began to wander south, Wyl coughed to get their attention.  But the kissing continued.
<br/>"I think we're heading for rocks," Wyl said, in an embarrassed whisper.
<br/>The kissing still continued and the hands were heading for the tropics.
<br/>Wyl shouted as loud as he could, "All hands on deck!  Land ho!""
<br/>That got their attention; they both rushed out on deck, giggling and holding hands. Wyl followed.
The Captain uttered a few orcish words under his breath and the ship slowed.  He ran up to the poop deck and took the wheel.
Wyl joined the Captain, while his sea-wife went below.
</p>
<p>
"Dangerous waters these," said the Captain, "I reckon that be the western shore o' the Sea o' Dreams."
<br/>Wyl followed the Captain's gaze and saw a distant strip of beach, then said, "That's where I want to land."
<br/>"I won't be takin' 'er in much closer lad, I don't know these 'ere waters.  You can row in; I'll let thee take a dinghy."
<br/>"Thank you Captain, that is most gracious."
<br/>The Captain shook his head, "Nay shipmate. I thank thee kindly; I never thought to see ol' briny again."
<br/>"Ha ha! I'll bet ol' briny missed you too, cap'n."
<br/>"Aye, 'appen she did, ha hargh!"
<br/>"The Captain stepped forward and gave Wyl a warm hug."
<br/>"Now, get below for some chow, while I sling the dinghy!"
<br/>"Aye aye, cap'n."
</p>

<p>
Within the hour, Wyl was waving goodbye to Captain 'Typhoon' Morgan and his sea-wife, full-fed and watered.
He drew steadily on the oars and the Rum Curio soon seemed small and distant. The water lapped gently against the dinghy.
The sea was serenely calm and a sense of peace fell upon him. He dreamed of home.  He recollected a time in his mother's kitchen, many years ago when he was just an apprentice...
</p>
<p>
It was her birthday and she was singing as she baked a cake.
He ran up to her, feeling very proud of the fact that he had finally mastered sufficient magical skill, to make for her a special birthday present.
<br/>"Happy birthday Mum!" he said putting the small jar on the table, "It's Unwrinkle Cream, it straightens out your skin, your head and your life!"
<br/>"Cheeky!" she cried in mock shock. Then laughing, she chased him around the kitchen table until she caught him and then tickled and hugged him.
<br/>"Do you like your present?", he asked, once he stopped laughing and got his breath back.
<br/>She looked wistfully at the jar, "Oh yes, but I'll keep it for a very, very special day."
<br/>Then she popped it into the rack alongside her cooking spices and said, "Let's go buy pizza!"
</p>
<p>
Wyl was suddenly shaken from his reverie by the thud of something against the boat. He looked around and saw a dark shape drifting away astern.
He kept on rowing and the indeterminate shape disappeared into the distance. The Rum Curio was gone over the horizon.
Then there was another thud. He shipped the oars and looked over the side.
<br/>"Ugh!" he gasped as he came face to face with a fishy-eyed corpse.
<br/>It was vaguely humanoid but too rotten to classify clearly. It drifted astern so he took up the oars and carried on rowing.
Then there was a double thud. He dug the oars in to stop the boat. He looked over the side again, expecting to see a corpse this time.
There were three. Two were Murloc, the mottled semi-humanoid amphibians that were common in watery places. The other corpse, was a gnome!
He quickly resumed rowing until soon the boat was being bumped frequently by floating corpses.
Wyl noted many races among them, from humans to orcs.  On he went.
Collisions with floating corpses became more and more frequent until the sea surface was almost hidden by cadavers and the rowing was becoming very tiring.
The stench got increasingly acrid, until it became unbearable.
He shipped the oars and scrabbled around in his backpack until he found the Necromancer's Nosegay and slipped it over his face.  Just as he was closing his backpack, he noticed the pendant his long lost love had thrown to him, when he was within the dream house of the enchantress.
He took it out and looked at it more closely.  It was the shape of a crescent moon and the gems on it were glowing faintly.
<br/>He mumbled to himself, "If this is here now, she must have been real too, no mere figment of a dream?"
<br/>He looked again at the pendant, then he held it to his forehead, to explore it with his magi sensibilities.
He sensed an enchantment; it could be used to reanimate a corpse.
<br/>"Reanimate a corpse!" tears filled his eyes as he cried out angrily to the heavens, "Gods answer me!  Is she dead?"
<br/>The gods, and the crowd of floating cadavers, answered not.
A tiny warming spark within him was suddenly snuffed out.  He mulled over his memories of her, memories that were now firmly in the past.
He cast his gaze over the sea of dead around him, a sea of lost hopes.
</p>
<p>
He recalled some words of an old friend, a renowned healer and master of elemental magic,
"See the clouds?  Heed them well, for they tell you what tomorrow brings; whether it will be warm or cold, stormy or calm.
Left alone, nature will unfold exactly as it should.  And when you look deep into a lover's eyes, heed the clouds there too, but, take care to nurture the unfolding."
<br/>"And if I see anger in those eyes?"
<br/>"What is anger? It is but a cry from our spirit to resolve something that has defeated our reason; it is irrational by nature.
Like all emotions, it is a wisp.  Listen now, to the sea; it slowly washes away the ancient rocks upon which we stand and the fossils within.
But those fossils are merely the remains of the empty shells; that which animated them has long since ceased to be."
<br/>"Then may the gods grant me a heart of stone."
<br/>"Do not wish for that my friend, for then your life would be as dead and empty as these fossils."
</p>
<p>
As the boat bobbed gently, Wyl looked up into the featureless grey mist.
<br/>"I am not dead yet!" he shouted defiantly at the insouciant gods.
</p>
<p>
He looked over the side of the boat for something that looked vaguely humanoid.
There were several to choose from, amongst several that he didn't care to look at too closely.
Wyl dragged one with an oar until it bobbed against the boat. Then, he cast his trinket levitation spell to lift it from the water and dropped it into the stern.
It was partly decomposed, but looked like it had all its parts.
He slipped the pendant over the head of the slumped corpse. The three red jewels of the pendant glowed repeatedly in sequence for a few moments.
Eventually, the corpse began to twitch and disgusting slurping sounds emanated from it, like inward farting!
The decrepit flesh began to firm up. The eyeball that hung by threads on the right cheek, slurped back up into it's socket, with a loud pop!
The corpse righted itself and blinked. Then it inhaled a long, deep breath, causing its ribs to crack loudly, as its chest expanded, making Wyl wince.
Then it violently coughed up sea water for several minutes, until it finally sat upright and looked straight at Wyl.
</p>
<p>
"Considering how long you must have been in the water, you don't look half bad."
<br/>"There is plenty of other fish-food floating about round here."
<br/>"Yes, I noticed. What was your name?"
<br/>"I am Krendal, the warrior."
<br/>"I am Wyl, the mage. You're from the Exodar?"
<br/>"Aye, a long time ago."
<br/>"So, what took place here?"
<br/>"You don't know?"
<br/>"No, I never passed this way before."
<br/>"Then turn the boat around and go back to where you came from."
<br/>"I have to complete a quest."
<br/>"An entire army perished here!  This place is accursed."
<br/>"Nevertheless. Take my place and row, I intend to go on."
<br/>"As you command."
<br/>They carefully moved around each other in the boat and Wyl sat at the stern as Krendal took the oars and began to row.
</p>
<p>
The powerful Draenei soon made much better headway than Wyl had been able to.
<br/>They travelled through the mists for about half an hour before the warrior spoke again, "How long will my resurrection last?"
<br/>"As long as you wear that pendant, you will be alive, sort of. Remove it and you will die. I will let you keep it until we get to the far shore."
<br/>"Would you consider letting me use it for longer? I have unfinished business there."
<br/>"I hope you're not planning on visiting any past lovers, you look pretty gruesome."
<br/>"No, it's revenge. If you help me exact it, it could work in your favour."
<br/>"How?"
<br/>"You're going to the Black Citadel, are you not?"
<br/>"To tell the truth, all I know for sure is that I must go west.
I have to complete a quest, yet I have only a vague dream fragment relating it's purpose and my part in it."
<br/>"I would be a very powerful ally.  And my friend, you may have given me the edge in death, I never had in life.
I came here as part of an army. Our enemies were well prepared for an army. But perhaps now, drunk upon their victory, they will fall victim to a subtler attack."
<br/>"A berserking, undead, Draenei warrior... subtle?"
<br/>"Ha ha! Perhaps not. I just need to get within striking distance of the Arcanist, somehow, before he has a chance to summon demonic help through his portal."
<br/>"Arcanist? Portal?  Of course, portal. I think maybe I have an edge too," said Wyl, as he rummaged about in his backpack.
<br/>Krendal watched as Wyl unfolded an old, tattered copy of the Journal of the Thirsty Chemical Society,
to reveal a small black stone carving, of a snake swallowing its own tail.
<br/>"This is the Ouroboros of Benzol.  A teacher of mine once took me on a boost through a dungeon,
where this dropped after a frantic fight with a mass of serpent-worshipping, alchemist sorcerers.
It was my first ever epic drop, so even though I often thought it a waste of bag space, I keep it."
<br/>"And what does it do?" said Krendal.
<br/>"It allows me to tune-in to any portal, within a short range, and reverse teleport something out of it."
<br/>"What range?"
<br/>"My teacher made me practice over and over, teleporting sheep from Elwynn Forest to the Mage District of Stormwind, through a portal she had cast there.
I got so bored, I played a little joke on her," Wyl sniggered.
<br/>"What joke?" asked Krendal, attempting a smile but achieving a gruesome sardonic grin at best.
<br/>"I sent her a sheep that wasn't a sheep; a wolf in sheep's clothing, you might say."
<br/>Wyl found Krendal's mucous-gargling laugh slightly nauseating.
<br/>Wyl went on, "She killed the wolf easily of course, as soon as it transformed from sheep back to wolf, but it did make her jump."
<br/>They both chuckled at the thought.
<br/>"So, if I get close enough, I should be able to teleport myself straight into the heart of the Black Citadel, if that's where I need to be."
<br/>"I have a better idea. Why don't you teleport a berserking, undead, Draenei warrior instead? Imagine the look on the acolytes faces!"
<br/>They both roared so much with laughter, that they almost capsized the boat! And perhaps they would have, if the boat hadn't finally beached.
<br/>"I guess we walk from here. As we go, tell me about the Black Citadel, I know not yet if that is my destination." said Wyl.
</p>
<p>
They slipped out of the boat into knee deep water. Krendal pushed through the floating corpses and Wyl followed in his wake.
Before long they were having to walk over the slimy bodies, slipping and sliding, to reach the dry sand.
The beach itself was littered with countless dead.  As they headed inland, the fog began to lift and thin, until it floated like a shroud over the unbroken field of the fallen.
Although it was a scene of terrible carnage, Wyl saw too, an obscene beauty; it was as if the hand of a great artist had wrought the lifeless clay, the mist and the light into a perfect composition.  A glimpse of a dream flit through his memory, and with it, came a deep conviction that he was meant to be here.  His feelings of horror and disgust were displaced by a gentle calm.
</p>
<p>
The mist began to clear ahead. As Wyl looked up the beach he could see nothing but corpses upon corpses.
Many were badly mutilated, with bones and skulls exposed. As they continued inland, up a shallow cliff, the sea-mist evaporated and they stood in baking sunshine.
Here, the corpses wriggled incessantly with charnel worms and dense clouds of flies buzzed and swirled around everywhere.
The hill of corpses rose before them until they saw, beyond it, in the far distance, a great fortress in the shape of a shiny obsidian skull.
Where its top teeth would have been, were the bars of a massive portcullis. A tall pointed tower rose like a huge spear shaft from the top of the skull, high into the clear blue sky.
</p>
<p>
Just ahead of where they stood, the sun glinted brightly on something metallic, held within the fist of a stocky dwarven forearm, that stood defiantly out from a mound of corpses.
<br/>"Look, he took at least a dozen of the enemy with him!" said Krendal, as they stopped by the mound of twisted, tangled and battered cadavers.
<br/>Wyl looked down at the face of the corpse holding the shiny object. Ironically, the face of the fallen soldier smiled sardonically back in death.
His face was as yet ungnawed by the worms and he still looked young, bold and handsome; a valiant visage that would grace any memorial to a heroic victory.
<br/>Wyl suddenly felt sad. He let his gaze sweep around over the countless dead that now surrounded them on all sides, "What in the name of the gods happened here?"
<br/>"War; No matter how nobly it begins, it always looks this way in the end."
<br/>Wyl pulled the shiny object from the dead dwarf's hand; it was a bejewelled locket.
His magi instincts sensed no intrinsic magic, but there was a faint ghostly aura. He popped open the locket to reveal the image of a pretty, happy, dwarven maiden.
<br/>The tears welled up in Wyl's eyes as he focussed on the aura and recounted its tale to Krendal,
"When he realised he was facing defeat, he bellowed a curse upon his enemies, then cast aside his bloodied war hammer,
which hadn't left his side since the day his father bestowed it upon him, at the Great Forge.
He took hold of the locket hanging from his neck, where she had placed it with a kiss, on the day he marched out.
Then laughing, he cried out her name, as their weapons pierced his armour. With his final breath, he thanked her for her love, as he raised his fist into the air."
<br/>With a heavy sigh, Wyl replaced the locket, "It must be true, what they say; that the Golden Age is over.  All the heroes are dead."
<br/>Krendal put his hands on Wyl's shoulders and stooped to look deep into his eyes.
Then he said solemnly, "I too thought all the brightest and the best had died on this blasted shore. But no.
All is now clear; my rebirth is no accident. The gods have brought us together. I will fulfil my warrior destiny after all."
<br/>"Warrior destiny?"
<br/>Krendal stood tall and looked into the bright sky,
"Powerful runes were cast upon my birth. Portents that foretold I would fight and serve at the right hand of a future king;
the king of the Second Golden Age. So, as I drowned beneath the weight of my foes in this accursed sea, without even letting blood in the citadel itself,
the tragedy of my unfulfilled destiny beat me down, more assuredly than the swords and axes of my adversaries.
With all of our knights and princes, savants and sages, slain around me, what meaning was there left to my existence? None, it seemed."
<br/>"What are you talking about?  I am no king!"
<br/>"We took down thousands upon thousands of the Legion and all their hellish demons! But they were too many and too strong.
We represented the combined might and magic of the Alliance and the Horde, yet we could not withstand the onslaught.  And, you have released me from the curse."
<br/>"The Legion? The Burning Legion?! When was this?"
<br/>"When? Oh, show me your astrolabe."
<br/>With an impatient click of his fingers, Wyl conjured a hologram of the current position of the planets.
<br/>After studying it for a moment, Krendal exclaimed, "Oh! About a hundred years ago!"
<br/>Wyl dismissed the astrolabe in an irritated manner and glared at the huge Draenei with his hands on his hips, "Why are all these bodies still here, not even half rotted?"
<br/>"The battle is not over.  It is a conflict of the cursed.
You brought me back from a ghostly battlefield in limbo, where I thought we and our fallen enemies were condemned to continue fighting for eternity."
<br/>Wyl looked towards the citadel.
<br/>"Look," continued the Draenei, becoming equally irritated, "we didn't win the battle here, but neither did they, otherwise all of Azeroth would be ravaged by demons and hell-fire by now.
Maybe you could be just a little grateful for that!"
<br/>"So why haven’t I heard tales of it before, longshanks?!"
<br/>"Because no one lived to tell the tale, shorty! They fight on, even in death."
<br/>"Come to think of it, there is a legend I vaguely recall, of an army that ventured out never to return.
The legend says they will reappear when the kingdoms are once again in mortal danger. But then, the legends always say that.  Hey, big guy, I guess you're it!"
<br/>Krendal hissed through his teeth, "You're right about one thing, you're no king. Nevertheless, I will serve you. Maybe you will be a king one day."
<br/>"Oh sure."
<br/>"When you grow up!" shouted the Draenei.
<br/>"Yeah! A king with a one-man army!" Wyl shouted back.
<br/>They stood in furious silence for a few moments, until Krendal suddenly stared at Wyl, mouth agape.
<br/>"What is it?" said Wyl.
<br/>As he relaxed, Krendal said, "Brave comrade, it would have been an honour to fight at your side, but I am afraid our friendship will be cut short."
<br/>"Why? Aren't you coming with me to the citadel? Oh, wait, I'm not sure I even need to go there at all!"
<br/>"I should have thought of it before.  There is one here who should go in my place, if we can find him.  He should wear your magic pendant and be your one man army."
<br/>"But..."
<br/>"Yes, I know.  I will have to give up my new-found life, which suddenly seems so very sweet, and return to the battlefield of the damned.
Nevertheless, there is another more worthy."
<br/>"And who might that be?"
<br/>"The King himself. No mightier warrior has yet drawn breath. And, he is a great warlord of consummate skill in both tactics and strategy.
He will help you in ways I cannot.  In this way perhaps, my destiny is fulfilled after all."
<br/>"Very well, if we can find him," said Wyl, surveying the vast sprawl of cadavers, "That won't be easy."
<br/>"I think I know where to look," said Krendal.
<br/>Wyl followed his gaze, towards the Black Citadel.

<p class="expand">
Enter ruined citadel.  Find acolytes rushing to contruct machine for mass rezz when alignment happens
(but don't know that's what it is yet - only find out when King is rezzed).  Find King.
[Chap 8: Find Queens body. Kill acolytes and take over the rezz machine.]

<br/>"See that small knoll, piled high with dead and topped with a copse of rusty spears and tattered banners?"
<br/>"Yes, I see it."
<br/>"Come."
<br/>Wyl followed the big Draenei as they stumbled across the field of bodies. Within ten minutes they stood at the foot of the knoll.
</p>
<p>
It was clear a terrific fight had taken place around the hillock by the sheer number of demonic corpses that surrounded it.
But the corpses strewn across the crest of the small hill were mostly from the races of Azeroth.
Chief amongst them lay the massive body of the dead king, who stood out from even this assembly of boldly chiselled champions.
<br/>"This is goodbye then," said the Draenei sadly, as he stooped and lifted Wyl from the ground.
<br/>They hugged warmly, then Krendal put Wyl gently down, smiling through his sparkling tears.  Krendal sat down beside the corpse of the king.
<br/>"Tell him, I served him with honour, to the end."
<br/>"I will."
<br/>"Good fortune, my friend."
<br/>Without hesitation, Krendal lifted the pendant over his head and immediately gagged and slumped forward, stiff and unmoving.
Although he'd hardly known him, Wyl felt as if he'd lost a brother.  A sudden chill breeze ruffled the big man's hair.
Wyl squatted beside him and looked into the lifeless eyes for a few moments.
<br/>As he took the pendant from the Draenei's dead grasp, he whispered softly, "Goodbye, my friend.  May the spirit-healer spare you the eternal battle and speed you to your ancestors."
<br/>He stood and watched as grains of sand, lifted by the wind, collected in the folds of the dead warrior's clothing.
He suddenly felt very, very alone and longed for home.  He recalled his mother's warm smile, which he missed so very much.
He looked back towards the sea and thought of abandoning the quest and returning home.  Then he looked back at the dead Draenei.
<br/>"For you, brother in arms, for you.  And for Eweline."
</p>
<p>
Wyl thought of the old witch, to whom he had promised he would complete this quest.  She had taught him so much.
He recalled their last meeting, just before he set out on the quest.  They had said their goodbyes and as Wyl was leaving, he turned to give her a final wave.
But an owl flew in through the window, hung for a moment on a breath of air, then with a flash, transformed into a tall, ruggedly-handsome night-elf druid.
Eweline smiled sweetly and held out her hands, which the druid took into his, also smiling.  She blossomed upon his touch and a  thousand years of weariness fell away from her.
The way they looked at each other, with such deep affection, made Wyl momentarily jealous.  Even old people, he realised, can fall deeply in love.
</p>
<p>
He looked down at the corpse of the King, "I hope you're at least half the man Krendal thought you were."
<br/>Wyl held the head of the King with one hand and slipped the pendant over his head with the other.  He stepped back as the pendant gems flickered.
The King leapt to his feet and roared!  For a moment, Wyl thought the King would attack him with his huge two-handed sword.
<br/>Then the King relaxed and spoke to Wyl with a surprisingly gentle voice, "Greetings, Wyl of Ironforge."
<br/>"Have we met?"
<br/>"This moment was shown to me in a scrying bowl, when I was but a boy.  Though much about you remained in shadow, all the seers linked my destiny with thine.
My mother would recount tales of your legendary deeds as she put me to bed.  As I grew, I was inspired by your courage and your heart.
Now at last, I meet the legend."
<br/>"But, I haven't performed any great deeds."
<br/>"Ha ha!" the King laughed, as he patted Wyl on the back, "Starting today, we write your legend into the history books of Azeroth,
from where it will inspire future kings and kingdoms to greatness!"
<br/>The King lifted his sword behind him and sheathed it on his back, "And Krendal too, whose honour and bravery are well known to us.
Now, let us find my dear queen.  She lies somewhere on this battlefield."
