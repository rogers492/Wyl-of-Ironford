<p class="intro">
For three more days Wyl travelled: through a forest, then down into a rocky valley,
then up into another area of woodland.  There were a few lesser bears and wolves around,
but they were wary of a gnome of such obvious power, so they left him alone.
</p>

<p>
The forest seemed to become featureless and unchanging for a time, until Wyl chanced upon
a sunlit glade.  At the centre of the glade was a crystal clear pool, fed by a gently burbling brook.
Across the pool, a beautiful nymph bathed in the waters.  Wholly unaware of his presence, she wrung
the water from her long dark silky hair.  She danced in the shallow pool and splashed in play with
the sparkling wisps that flit across the water, her laugh deeply sensual but brimming with joyful girlish giggles.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, a squealing puck burst into the glade, immediately followed by three satyrs, all wielding heavy clubs.
The nymph and the puck were quickly surrounded by the nimble hoofed satyrs.  One of the satyrs began casting a net,
but the nymph parried it and dodged past the caster. But the puck was caught by a hefty club and fell.
Though she could have escaped, the nymph hesitated at the cries of the puck and the lead satyr managed to
net her on his second attempt.
</p>

<p>
Wyl dismounted and cast <em class="spell">Frost-Bolt</em>, slowing the lead satyr, giving the nymph time to break
free of the net.  Then suddenly, even before the satyr's furious roars had faded, the glade was filled with a swarm of
tomtes, hobs and pixies, who fell upon the satyrs with a barrage of magical and physical attacks.
The quiet peace of the glade was shattered with thuds, pops, bangs, whizzes and flashes.
As the satyrs scattered to flee the glade, the lead satyr ran towards Wyl.  Wyl quickly began casting
<em class="spell">Frost-Nova</em>, but, as they closed on each other, their gazes locked and Wyl was surprised to see
there a deep, humane sadness, rather than animal bestiality.  The bloodied satyr stared back at Wyl, club raised hesitantly.
Wyl cancelled his cast and the satyr gave a brief nod of recognition for his act of mercy, before bolting past Wyl into the forest.
</p>

<p>
"Greetings stranger," came a voice from behind.
<br />Wyl turned quickly to see a regal looking fairy hovering just above the ground,
her large colourful butterfly wings fluttering gracefully.  Her pink sparkling hair was piled precariously upon her head
and topped with a petite crown of petals; she held a large flower like a sceptre in one hand and a
large seed pod like an orb in the other.
<br />She spoke calmly, "Please accept our gratitude for your intervention."
<br />"Greetings and thank you," said Wyl, relaxing.
<br />"I am Clovis, High Priestess of the Corioli."
<br />"I am Wyl of Ironford, a humble mage, at your service."
<br />"Ah, Ironforge; a place of such great industry!  I have passed the time with pleasant company there, but I am always
happy to return to the blessings of our quiet glade."
<br />"Indeed it is pleasant here." said Wyl, ignoring the misunderstanding over his place of origin.
<br />"Come, please let us offer you refreshment."
<br />"Thank you."
</p>

<p>
The home of the Corioli was a small wooden village around a moonwell, at which a crowd had gathered.
<br />Clovis gestured to the moonwell, "Thanks in part to you, our short ceremony can now take place.  I would be honoured if you would attend."
<br />"Thank you again," said Wyl, "The honour is mine."
<p>Wyl stood and watched as Clovis stood before the fairy couple he had helped to rescue.
They were stood holding hands, faces bright with the sparkling moonbeams from the well,
smiling despite their recent ordeal.  Clovis hushed the assembly as the couple knelt before her.
She held two old gnarled oaken staves, one in each hand, and chanted an ancient ritual into the sky.
<br />"Spirits of the fae, hear our plea.  By your grace and favour, the time has come to disavow the
beloved before us.  Grant us this, in your name."
<br />Then Clovis spoke to the couple, "Have you loved each other, from dawn until dusk of every Summer day?"
<br />The couple answered together, "Yes, we have."
<br />"Have you loved each other, from dusk until dawn of every Summer night?"
<br />"Yes, we have."
<br />Then I declare, by the power of the Staves of Coriolis, that your vows are now broken.
You are now free of your bondage to each other.  You may say your goodbyes."
<br />The crowd cheered and applauded as the couple hugged and kissed tenderly.
</p>

<p>
Clovis lay down the staves and embraced the couple in turn as they parted.
<br />The puck addressed the crowd, "I depart now, for our settlement in Outland,
where there is much to do in repairing the harm the wars there have wrought."
<br />The crowd applauded again.
<br />The nymph then spoke, "I wish to embrace the Autumn."
<br />Clovis laughed heartily, "Then so you shall, Asthene," she said, as she picked up one of the staves.
<br />Clovis and Asthene conferred briefly in whispers.
<br />Then Clovis turned to the crowd, "Let it be known that Asthene will be offering the warmth and wisdom of her Autumn
and that she has declared an affinity with all.  So, eligible partners, please step forward as you wish;
the first three to so declare shall enter the ritual."
</p>

<p>
Excited murmuring spread through the assembled throng as they looked around to see who might step forward.
Within moments, a distinguished looking bearded gentleman of middle years stepped through the crowd.  Clad mostly in soft leather and with a large
white feather in the front of his broad-brimmed hat, Wyl thought perhaps he was an adventurer or well travelled and well-to-do merchant.
Immediately, another suitor fluttered above the heads of the crowd. She was voluptuous and scantily dressed in
what seemd to Wyl like living ivy; the veins of her gossamer wings glowed gold and she left a faint trail
of will-o-the-wisps as she flew over the crowd and alighted beside him, to applause from the crowd.
Her perfume was sweet and slightly intoxicating, until suddenly, a loud shout from behind Wyl turned the applause to shocked and angry whispers.
It was the bruised and bloodied satyr who had tried to abduct Asthene earlier.
<br />"Hold!" cried Clovis, as elements of the crowd made to attack the satyr again.
<br />Clovis turned to address the satyr, "Speak, Rojaz!"
<br />Rojaz gave a grateful nod to Clovis, but then looked to the nymph at her side, "Asthene, I have loved you from afar,
even as I have dishonoured you and myself.  But, I would honour you with all my heart, should you bless me with your Autumn."
<br />The crowd muttered loudly until Clovis shouted again, "Silence!"
<br />Then Clovis conferred in a whisper with Asthene.
<br />She turned back to the satyr, "To honour Asthene, you must first honour the Staves of Coriolis.
Even some of our own kind are rejected.  Are you prepared to take the Trial of the Staves, Rojaz?"
<br />"I am!" declared Rojaz defiantly.
<br />Clovis had to shout over the astonished mutterings of the crowd, "Then so be it!"
</p>

<p>
She took up the other staff and walked past the satyr, into the forest, "Come, one and all."
Wyl followed with the fairy crowd, until they all gathered around a fallen tree, where Clovis stood with a staff in each hand.
<br />Clovis handed one of the staves to Rojaz, "Plant the staff here.  Renewal will signify your acceptance by Coriolis;
otherwise you will rot and I shall strike you down to free your spirit, alas to wander the forests alone for evermore."
<br />Rojaz looked longingly at Asthene.  She looked back with heartfelt concern.  Rojaz smiled at that and mouthed a kiss.  Asthene smiled back.
Rojaz took a firm grip of the staff with both hands, holding it vertical, lifted it high, then drove it hard through the rotten wood of the fallen,
fungus covered tree, into the mossy earth beneath.  Both hands still gripping the staff tightly, he waited, while everyone watched with bated breath.
The crowd gasped as a tiny green bud grew from just below the top of the staff, while roots grew out from the foot to sink into the dark earth.
Rojaz roared and released the staff as it took on the form of a young sapling.
<br />"Renewal!" shouted Clovis, "His heart has been tested and accepted by Coriolis."
</p>

<p>
As the crowd cheered, Rojaz ran to Asthene.  They stood nose to nose for a second, before Clovis held out the other staff.
Asthene took a deep breath then took the staff.  The two other suitors stood before Asthene too, either side of Rojaz.
Clovis stood before her and performed the ancient ritual of the staves to call upon the favour of the fairy gods.
<br />As Clovis finished, Asthene closed her eyes, planted the staff firmly and cried, "Coriolis, grant me please, an Autumn of warmth, wisdom and love."
<br />A bright yellow leaf drifted down to rest upon her shoulder.  Then another, then a red one, then an orange one.
Faster and faster the leaves spiraled down, until they had formed a fabulous Cloak of Autumn, hanging gracefully from her shoulders.
For a moment the leaves stopped falling; Asthene stood still with her eyes screwed tight-shut. Then a single golden leaf drifted down,
spiralling slowly around and weaving this way and that on the air, until it landed gently upon the head of Rojaz.  The other two suitors lead the crowd in thrilled applause
and Asthene opened her eyes. She whooped to see the leaf on the head of Rojaz.  She took a step forward, removed her Cloak of Autumn and placed it
around the shoulders of Rojaz.  Magically, the leafy cloak clasped around his neck.  Rojaz and Asthene embraced warmly, to cheers from the crowd.
Then Rojaz and Asthene skipped joyfully around the clearing.
</p>

<p>
As the crowd dispersed, Clovis put a hand on the shoulder of Wyl and laughed, "Come young mage, let's get that refreshment I promised.
It's been a strange day, but then the whole world is changing too fast for an old fairy."
<br />"Ha! It's changing too fast for a young mage," Wyl laughed with her.
<br />As Clovis and Wyl turned to go, Rojaz and Asthene trotted towards them and called out, "Mage, wait!"
<br />Clovis and Wyl waited until Rojaz and Asthene stood before them.
<br />"We have a gift for you," said Asthene, "A thank you, for the mercy you showed to Rojaz and the happiness it has brought us."
<br />Asthene unclasped the cloak from around Rojaz and held it out to Wyl. Wyl hesitated.
<br />"Please take it," said Rojaz, "I have the Autumn of Asthene to keep me warm."
<br />Wyl looked askance at Clovis.
<br />Clovis nodded assent, "Outwith the ritual, it is a magical cloak like any other, you can take it."
<br />"Then I am greatly honoured and I thank you," said Wyl as he took the cloak.
<br />He removed his own cloak and wrapped the <em class="spell">Cloak of the Fairy Bride in Autumn</em> around his shoulders.
Immediately he felt the rush of extra manna and increased spell power from the intellect and wisdom endowed by the cloak.
<br />Wyl looked at Rojaz and Asthene, who were now lost in each other's eyes, and said, "I wish you both a long and happy Autumn."
<br />Rojaz and Asthene grinned widely and ran off into the forest, their laughter echoing around the glade.
<br />Clovis looked after them, smiling wistfully, her eyes filled with affection, "It'll be a warm and wet one, no doubt."
<br />Then Clovis turned her full attention to Wyl and looked deep into his eyes, her bosom heaving in time with her deep breathing, "Would you care to join me in tonight's celebrations?"
<br />"I think, yes, I would." said Wyl.
<br />Clovis laughed seductively and took Wyl by the hand, "Then come."
