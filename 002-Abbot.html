<h1 class="chapterHeading">ABBOT</h1>

<p class="intro">
Just as the leprechaun had said, the <em class="place">Alizarin Monastery</em> was easy to find.
The monks at the gate were suspicious at first but the officious looking Abbot
appeared and brushed them aside, so Wyl soon found himself on a tour of the monastery.
</p>

<p>
"All the way from mighty Ironforge indeed.  It is my very great pleasure to welcome such an illustrious guest.
Do please come this way.  We have many things that will interest a discerning gentleman such as yourself.
Within these walls, we have chosen a life of service to the holy light. We devote our labours to tasks that
shine the pure light of holy reason, onto those deep shadows of ignorance that, in these dark days,
blight the lives of so many.  Of course, we do have builders, farmers, smiths, tailors and other honest and
essential professions amongst us.  However, our most gifted servants of the light dedicate themselves solely to,
that most noble of vocations, inscription.  And here we are, the scriptorium!"
</p>

<p>
The Abbot pushed open the heavy door and they strode into a warm room filled with several desks.
At each, a monk sat scribing intently on manuscript.  Wyl followed the Abbot as he strode to the
centre of the room, where they halted before one of the desks.
<br />"Brother Ambrose here, has spent fifteen years, working on just, this, single, letter -
the <em class="spell">Glyph of Wasted Talents!</em>" announced the Abbot with an unabashed swagger.
<br />Brother Ambrose paused his writing, with the wet nib poised adroitly over the magnificent swirl of
line and colour, making no effort to disguise his pride, as he beamed up at Wyl.
<br />"Oh dear," said the Abbot, "I think, Brother, that I may have inadvertently caused you to blot your work."
<br />With bated breath, they all leaned in to look closer; there was a blot of fresh black ink,
slowly expanding across the middle of the glorious glyph. The face of Brother Ambrose turned
to alabaster, as tears welled up in his eyes.
<br />"Take heart Brother," said the Abbot as he lay a gentle hand on the shoulder of
Brother Ambrose, "Thy good intentions are thy salvation."
</p>

<p>
The Abbot moved along a couple of desks, with Wyl in tow, pausing only slightly in deference
to the quiet sobbing of Brother Ambrose, before he introduced the next scribe.
<br />"This is Brother Gwillym, an authority on enchanting vellum.  If there is any weapon or
armour enchantment you desire, then just name it and Brother Gwillym will prepare it before you leave."
<br />"Well actually, I think I have everything I need for now, thank you," said Wyl.
<br />"Well then, Brother Gwillym, perhaps a minor vellum, as a mere memento for our illustrious guest?"
<br />"Oh thank you Abbot, I am greatly honoured," said the scribe with a genuine smile, "I am very pleased
with the one I have just inscribed," he continued, blowing on the ink as he proffered the vellum to Wyl.
<br />Wyl took the vellum and read the inscription: <em class="spell">The Fiery Wrath of the Spirited Woman's Profanity;
chance on hit; causes fifty fire damage; silences all enemies within twenty yards for twenty seconds.</em>
<br /><span class="pic">insert pic</span>
<br />"You are clearly very talented, Brother Gwillym," Wyl said, smiling back, "I humbly accept your most gracious gift."
<br />The scribe and the Abbot looked satisfied as Wyl rolled the vellum and put it into his backpack.
</p>

<p>
The Abbot lead on, towards another heavy door, which he unlocked noisily with one of the many large iron keys that hung from his belt.
<br />As he pushed the door open he announced, "And now, the repository of all our finest works, the <em class="place">Library of Illuminations!</em>"
<br />"But what of this impressive body of works?" asked Wyl, indicating a nearby scribe surrounded by piles of completed sheaves,
who was scribbling furiously, adding to the pile even as they watched.
<br />"Ah, yes, Brother Archer," sighed the Abbot, with an obvious lack of enthusiasm,
"He is no doubt working on his next best seller.  We must draw comfort from the fact that the work of
Brother Archer has kept our humble order going, through some difficult times."
<br />As the Abbot stepped through the doorway, Wyl took a sheaf from the top of the pile and
read the title - <em class="book">How to Get Rich Quick in Azeroth</em>.  He quickly replaced the sheaf and followed the Abbot into the library.
</p>

<p>
The extensive bookshelves were arranged around the outside wall and well lit by light from a central cloister.
<br />"Our library is the most extensive outside of Stormwind itself.  We have collected many original works and
made a considerable contribution of our own.  I am sure the knowledge you seek can be found on these shelves."
<br />"Thank you Abbot.  I am very grateful for your assistance.  Please accept this small token of gratitude,
that I hope will help you keep up your important good works," Wyl said, as he offered a pouch of coins.
<br />The Abbot smiled and bowed very slightly, "Most gracious.  You can be sure your generous contribution will
be put to good use in the service of the holy light."
<br />The Abbot pocketed the pouch then instructed Wyl as to the ordering of the shelves, "Maps and charts are along there,
just beyond the grimoires and spell-books.  Our two most celebrated works, <em class="book">The Scroll of Ineffable Truths</em> and <em class="book">The
Book of Worthless Promises</em>, are kept in a locked chest, and not made generally available."
<br />"Oh, why is that?"
<br />"Because, the High Council of the Holy Orders determined that, widespread understanding of such matters, might be, well,
bad for business.  However, an esteemed visitor such as yourself can be granted access on request."
<br />"Thank you Abbot, perhaps I will take advantage of your offer on my return journey.  For now, I will focus on the object of my quest."
<br />"As you wish. May the light guide you.  Oh! I almost forgot; please be aware that a few of the more esoteric volumes have
enchantments or other protections that seek to dissuade the undeserving from acquiring their deeper knowledge.
Do take care," said the Abbot as he bowed and withdrew.
</p>

<p>
Wyl made his way to the mapping section and scanned the many books on the shelves, some with fascinating titles:
<em class="book">Atlas of the Nether Regions (Unexpurgated), The Geological Survey of the Gem Merchant's Widow, Tourist Guide to the Spirit World,
  Visit The Higher Dimensions on Ten Gold a Day and, The Empire of the Empty Heart.</em>
</p>

<p>
Eventually, he came across <em class="book">The Complete Uncharted Seas - Second Edition</em>.  He took down the heavy scale-bound volume and
placed it on a nearby lectern.  He opened the book and checked the contents until he found the reference to The Sea of Dreams.
He opened the book at the page indicated; it was blank.
After a moment staring at the blank page, he went to close the book, but was startled when the book spoke, "Patience seafarer!
Your uncharted sea is being charted for you now," said the book.
Wyl waited and watched the blank page.  Lines began to appear, as if being drawn by an invisible pen.
A chart soon took shape, of an inland sea with a small island at its centre; The Isle of Disenchantment.
Wyl studied the map, committing it to memory, then closed the book and carefully replaced it on the shelf.
</p>

<p>
Wyl let his gaze roam freely around the other shelves.  He loved books and saw many interesting titles.
He resisted the temptation to take down a book for a browse, until his finger ran across: <em class="book">Mysteries of the Multiverse, volume XV -
Where Do The Odd Socks Go?</em>  He recalled his mum looking furiously perplexed on washday and thought this must be a truly profound
mystery to require a dedicated volume.  He took down the book, but, as he went to open it, a six-foot book-wyrm sprang from the pages
and wrapped its scaly coils tightly around him!  Wyl dropped the book in astonishment and managed to cast <em class="spell">Blink</em> before the book-wyrm
could exhale its fiery breath, teleporting himself to safety a few yards further down the aisle.  The book-wyrm fell to the floor,
then wriggled over to the book and shrank back between its pages.  Wyl regained his composure, then gingerly replaced the book,
before he hurriedly left the library.
