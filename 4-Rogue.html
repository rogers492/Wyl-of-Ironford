ROGUE


The next morning was damp and misty, with the clouds threatening rain.  Wyl ate the last of his Shroom Bread for breakfast, noting once again that it seemed to soothe his broken heart.  Then he waved goodbye to the dryads and rode out of the glade, over a ridge and carefully down the slippery wooded slope on the other side.  After an hour of fairly dense forest the trees thinned suddenly to a shoreline of dunes and coarse tufted grasses.  Wyl trotted out onto a small promontory overlooking a misty bay. He dismissed his mount and stood for several minutes to look out onto The Sea of Dreams.


Then, the Ring of Prescience, on the little finger of his left hand, began to tremble. He looked deep into the large blue gem atop the ring, at the swirling clouds within. The mists cleared to reveal the scene behind him; a pack of sentient rodents scurried about in the half-light beneath the trees, preparing their weapons and positioning for an attack.


Wyl spun around and cast his Frost Armour spell even as a flock of their arrows arched toward him. As they struck him, they froze and shattered into harmless powdered snow. Striding forward, he cast Arcane Missiles at the ringleader with one hand, as he pulled his wand from his belt with the other. The residual supernatural static flickered amongst them, making them dance and laugh like ticklish drunken revellers. With a flick of the wrist he flung Fireball at the group; it exploded among them setting their fur alight and causing screams and panic.   The attackers had had enough already and they turned to flee back into the forest.  It was barely a fight at all and Wyl was left wondering idly when he would ever get to exercise his wand.  He quickly cast a Frost Nova spell on one of the laggards, freezing him to the spot. The rest soon vanished, leaving their luckless comrade to his fate.


Wyl sauntered up to the captive, who shivered with the cold of the spell, but with fear too. Wyl unhitched his backpack and rifled through it until he pulled out the Eye of Remembering. He looked at the squishy eyeball within its nest of flesh and hair. As always, it looked as if it had been freshly torn from the head of its owner. It shed tears constantly, for it could never forget anything it had ever seen. Were they tears of sorrow or tears of joy? Who could know and stay sane with the knowledge? He quickly closed his hand over it, for he felt its insight stirring within his mind and as he knew only too well, it had a penchant for revealing memories you would rather forget. In any case, he had another subject for its examinations, one who was rapidly thawing.


He held the eye before the cowering rodent. The creature's feeble intelligence offered no resistance to the mental probing. A stream of memories and sensations tumbled into Wyl's mind, spinning backwards through time; sights, sounds, feelings; the full gamut of experience as the rodent had recently lived it; of the attack, the stalking, the packs early morning journey through the forest. Then, Wyl found what he sought; the captive was being berated by a particularly large and vicious looking ogre, beside a jetty with small boats - just what he needed to continue his journey. From the knowledge of the eye he knew where they were and how to get there. He put the eye back into his pack.  Though the freezing spell had worn-off, the rodent hadn't yet realized and stood in a daze.
Wyl raised his wand threateningly and shouted, "Begone!"


Wyl watched the rodent scurry into the forest as fast as his legs could carry him, while he mused on the deeper sadnesses the Eye had revealed within the mind of the rodent: Why am I always slower than the rest?  Why is everyone cleverer than me?  Why did mum never want to hug me?  Wyl conjured his mount and saddled-up.  Then he trotted along the southern shore into the thickening mists, wondering - why is it always 'why'?


Within the hour, Wyl arrived at the small fishing village on the bay. It was surrounded by a simple wooden palisade and had but one watchtower. Wyl knew it well, because the rodent whose memories he had stolen had grown up there. Even the smell of rotting fish wafting across seemed strangely comforting. The village was nothing more than a loose cluster of wooden huts around a rickety dock. The rodent villagers were going about their daily business. It would be difficult to just steal a boat without being seen, so a plan was called for.


He searched his backpack, looking for something to distract or quiesce the entire village. He had various dream philtres and sleeping potions, but it would be nigh impossible to drug everyone without being discovered.
He mumbled to himself as he rummaged, "Mmm, The Key to the Chastity Belt of the Thousand Year Virgin, never going to finish that quest," and tossed the key into the mud.
"Century Slumber Dust. Seems a little harsh to put them all to sleep for a hundred years just to borrow a boat."
"Burnt Midnight Oil. Ah, now that could do the trick," he whispered, swishing the dark fluid in the small, stoppered vial.


He looked up into the grey misty sky. The sun wasn't visible through the thick scudding clouds, but Wyl reckoned it must be a couple of hours to sunset. He found himself a dry spot and sat cross-legged amongst some tall, thick grasses.
As he wondered how he would subdue the village, his mind wandered, to that place it often did when his mind was unfocused, to the deep, dark eyes of the girl who lay within his heart; to her warm embrace; to their final kiss; to their last goodbye and that wonderful smile he hadn't realised he was seeing for the very last time.  He fell into a doze and dreamt of walking with her hand in hand, through a pleasant land of green and gentle hills.


He awoke with a shiver as a rivulet of cold rain trickled down his back. As his eyes focussed, the face of another formed before him; dark smouldering eyes looked out from between a shock of black hair and a red bandanna that masked the nose and mouth.  Wyl quickly took a firm grip on his staff, Dawning Wood, and tensed for action... but the stranger made no move.
After a few moments, Wyl spoke, "Good evening, rogue."
The stranger spoke quietly but deeply, with a thick gutter accent that seemed slightly affected, "Good evening, mage.  Careless of you to fall asleep."
"I sleep to dream."
"Then she must be a rare delight indeed. You are lucky to carry such a glow within your heart. Many yearn for such a dream, but merely sleep alone.  But, to business; I have a certain task to perform tonight in yonder village and I just wanted to make certain you and I are not going to get in each other's way."
"I also have a task in the village."
"Well, we could duel for the privilege, but that might attract unwanted attention."
"Most definitely."
"What is it you want in the village?"
"I want to steal a boat."
"Well, if that is all you want, we should have no quarrel. But, the village isn't as defenceless as it would first appear. It is the base for the local bandits."
"Yes, I know. They tried to ambush me earlier today."
"I see.  Then clearly you know how to handle yourself in a fight. Perhaps we can work together. I intend to collect the bounty on the head of their leader, Janmuri the Ogre. Of course, I also expect to help myself to their booty, but I could be persuaded to share."
"I agree collaboration would make the venture less risky for us both; I really have no need of anything but the boat."
The rogue shrugged, "As you wish. My plan was to quietly dispose of the sentries and then sneak into Janmuri's hut, assassinate him and his henchmen, loot the place and then sneak away. Unfortunately, when I scouted the place earlier I noticed he has a hellboar pet, which will smell me coming a mile off and wake the whole village."
"Mmmm, well my plan was to cast a nightmare curse diversion and steal a boat during the pandemonium. I was wondering how to get close to the centre of the village to cast the curse on a suitable subject or two. But, now you're here, I have an idea."
Despite the mask, Wyl could tell the rogue smiled knowingly.
"Yes," Wyl smiled back, "I will give you the agent of the curse. You can sneak in and curse the hellboar with it. It will sleep deeply, but all of it's worst nightmares will be projected into the real world for a few minutes. Only the gods can guess what phantasms of the fiery pit that creature will unleash upon the poor villagers!"
They both chuckled mischievously.
The rogue stood up, shaking off the raindrops, "The village has been quiet for a while, so we may as well get this over with. Then I can can get some sleep too."
The rain stopped and the clouds broke to reveal a gibbous moon that painted the ramshackle dwellings with a wan light.
“No matter,” whispered the rogue, looking skyward, “I’ll use stealth.”

Wyl collected his things and they crept down to a spot by the palisade and hid from the watchtower beneath a thick pall of smoke still rising slowly from the smoking-shed. As Wyl followed the rogue, he observed a smooth graceful movement and some fine feminine curves through the dark leather cuirass.
"You're a girl!"
The rogue spun around quickly and put her hand on the hilt of the brutal looking dagger at her waist.
"And what of it?!" she said in a stage whisper.
"Oh, nothing. But you were pretending to be a man."
"In my line of work, one uses many disguises."
"I suppose."
"Let's get on."
Wyl handed the vial to the rogue.
"Pour the oil onto some tasty morsel and lob it at the hellboar. There is enough for about ten minutes of nightmare. Ignore the nightmare phantoms, they will appear terrifying, but are harmless wisps. I will come in when I hear the screams."
The rogue slipped the vial into her waistband and nodded, "Thank you."
"By the way, I am Wyl. Who are you?"
"I?" her fading whisper was suddenly silkily feminine as she melted into the shadows.
"I?  I am the footfalls beneath your feet; I am the shade in the moon shadow; I am the kiss of the quick blade; I am the name on your final breath..."
Wyl stood very still and waited a few moments in silence, unsure at first that she had gone and strangely entranced by her final, somewhat theatrical whisperings. But then his rumbling stomach and the smell of kippers smoking reminded him how long it had been since breakfast.  If there was gold to be had, the rogue could keep it, he determined to loot himself some supper. He took his wand from his belt and listened intently.


Within moments, Wyl heard an agitated high pitched squeaking, which he took to be the screams of frightened rodents.  He used his Plume of the Fan-Dancer trinket, to levitate over the palisade and set-down just the other side, sniggering as he recalled the quest he had completed to obtain that particular trinket.  There was no sign of the rogue, but terrified rodents were scurrying in all directions,  their eyes bulging with fear.  Wyl ran past the smoking-shed, through the commotion and into the centre of the village, where he came to a sudden halt.  He could see the nightmare conjured by the hellboar; it was a thirty foot high hellboar sow.
Suddenly the rogue appeared, "I don't think that is the hellboar's nightmare; more like a wish come true, if the size of the mammaries are anything to go by!"
"Well, it seems to be working."
"But not quite as advertised; I just saw three rodents crushed to death beneath those mighty breasts.  That is no mere phantasm!"
"And it's headed this way!" cried Wyl in alarm.
"Run!  No! This way!  To the ogre!" commanded the rogue.
They skirted around the nearby huts until they were behind the huge sow.  Sure enough, the sow careened through a hut ahead of it and smashed it flat.  The horrible squeals from within the collapsing hut didn't last long.
"Where did you get that oil?  Booty Bay?"
"Not sure.  Darkmoon Faire, I think."
"Aha!  That'll teach you."
Then, bang!  Something heavy hit Wyl very hard on the back of the head and he was stunned.  As he spun around in a daze, he saw Janmuri the Ogre raising his wooden club to attack the rogue.  The rogue dodged the clumsy swipe and struck the ogre in the ribs with a swift stab of her savage looking dagger.  The ogre staggered and roared, but quickly raised his club again.  Wyl tried to cast a Frost Nova spell but was still incapacitated by the stun.  Two more ogres appeared, henchmen of Janmuri.  They crowded around the rogue and all three rained down blows while she did her best to duck and dive.  But a couple of glancing blows landed.  Even so, Wyl saw her dip her blade in poison as she rolled away from another vicious swing.  She lunged at one of the henchmen and stuck the poison blade in his fat belly even as the club of Janmuri whooshed just over her head.  Then, the other henchman caught her with a heavy blow and she was knocked backwards.  Janmuri turned to Wyl and lifted his club to strike, but Wyl shook himself out of his dazed state and cast Blink, reappearing twenty yards behind Janmuri, who looked dumbly around for the vanished mage.  Wyl cast Frost Nova and the feet of Janmuri were fixed within blocks of ice.  Janmuri had made the mistake of turning his back on the rogue; she dodged a swing by one of the henchmen to step up behind Janmuri and deliver a powerful backstab with her poison blade.  Janmuri sagged beneath the blow.  By now the poisoned henchman was turning green and clutching his throat.  Wyl fired Arcane Missiles at the other henchman just as he took aim at the rogue, and knocked him off his stride.  The rogue twisted around and stabbed the lethal blade into his belly.  Wyl launched a fireball at each of the ogres in turn.  The first poisoned henchman dropped to the ground with a loud thud.  The rogue now had a garotte around the throat of Janmuri and administered the kill as Wyl finished the other henchman with a blistering fireball.  By the time the fireballs stopped crackling, the three ogres lay still on the scorched earth.


Wyl looked around for the sow.  He could see it rampaging across the other side of the village, most of which was now splintered wood.
The rogue quickly looted the three ogre corpses, "Here, Janmuri has something I don't need."
Wyl stooped to collect the loot the rogue had left him; a small bottle of bright blue liquid, which had a single golden glyph embossed upon it.
"Come, the dock is this way," said the rogue.
They both ran along the rickety dock to the nearest sailing dinghy.  They clambered in and the rogue pushed them away from the dock, then took up the oars.  Wyl looked back to the shattered village.  The rodents were still in a panic, though it looked as if the hellboar sow had returned to the land of hellboar dreams.  Wyl felt pity for the rodents.
"We did them a favour," said the rogue, "They can rebuild their village and there will be no ogres to boss them around."
"I guess so." said Wyl, somewhat dismayed at the destruction and not entirely convinced that there weren't plenty of other ogres to take their place.
As they rowed further out onto the sea, Wyl hoisted the sail and took the tiller and mainsheet as the rogue stowed the oars.  The craft was soon running smoothly out of the bay on a steady beam reach, making for an easy sail.
“Head around the headland and then we’ll beach until morning,” said the rogue.
Wyl did as the rogue suggested and they were soon hauling the dinghy into a small deserted inlet.


As the rogue investigated the small beach and the nearby cliffs, Wyl looked again at the bottle he had looted from Janmuri.  The glyph looked familiar.  Then he recalled the crystal in his backpack.  He rummaged around until he found it; it looked lacklustre and neglected, but sure enough it bore the inverse imprint of the same embossed glyph.  Wyl felt guilty as he looked at it.  He put the bottle together with the crystal so the glyph images aligned and slotted together.  A puff of purple smoke rose from the crystal and formed a vision before him.


He saw an ancient white-haired alchemist with a long white beard, working busily over a hissing, burbling tangle of glass and copper apparatus.
The alchemist looked up, "Welcome stranger... ah, Wyl, is that you?”
Wyl said sheepishly, “Yes, it is I.”
“So, you still have the Soul-link?”
“Yes.”
“It's been a long time, my friend.”
“Yes it has. I'm sorry.”
After a brief moment of awkward silence, the alchemist smiled.
“So, you are wondering upon the nature of my work? It is the Elixir of Eternal Boyhood you possess. One of my finest potions, perfected over many years. Think carefully, before you use it. Surely, it will keep you young in mind and in body, until the end of thy natural term, such is its purpose. It will strip you of the weighty obligations of manhood. All feelings of responsibility will vanish, along with all the pain of failing to meet the expectations of others. Truly, thy life will be carefree for a time, filled full with play and petty dreams.  But be warned, you will lose your manly wisdom and every remembrance from which it has been forged.  You will forget all of thy deepest sorrows and all of thy most precious memories.  You will have no recollection of the warm glint in the eyes of thy one true love; who knew you to be a real man.  All thine acts of bravery, be they writ large or small upon the world, shall be unwoven from the fabric of time.  You will remain haunted by the childish fears you can never outgrow.  And when the end of your days arrives, there will be no sparkling diamonds shining proudly, from amidst the bitter ashes of thy many disasters.  You will count your life cheap, for what is the worth of a life filled with dreams you never had the courage to live?   It is your choice; be a boy, or be a man."
"An odd thing for an old ogre to possess," said Wyl.
“Not really, even old ogres hanker after the adventures of their boyhood.”
“And old alchemists?”
“They do sometimes... and sometimes... they drink too many potions for their own good.”
“I'm sorry I didn't get in touch.”
“The river flows faster than any of us realize.”
“I need your help now, if you don't mind?”
“Of course not, my friend.  How may I help you?”
“I'm lost and don't know how to find my way;  the sky above me is dark.  I remember the stars always shone for you.”
“Ah, then allow me.”
The alchemist looked up and waved his arm as if presenting the heavens.  The clouds were swept away by his gesture, to reveal a bright panoply of twinkling stars.
“There,” said the alchemist, pointing, “Just follow that bright star near the horizon.”
“Thank you, old friend, I will come visit, I promise.”
“Nay, Wyl, my flask lies cold and empty, beyond the plane of life.  I exist now only as the fading fragments of your memories.  Live well, old friend.”
The vision faded before Wyl, as tears filled his eyes.
