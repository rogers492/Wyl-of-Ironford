EHCHANTRESS


Within a short time, he was close enough to discern a large walled house of Moorish design nestled among tall palms.  It shimmered in the desert heat, so much at times that Wyl wondered if it might be a mirage.  The fierce sun burned remorselessly.  The hot dust scratched his throat and clogged his lungs.  Though he trudged steadily onwards, the palm fringed oasis seemed to get no nearer.  He stopped several times to drink until his stock of spring water was depleted.  When he conjured more, he realised his manna was ebbing away,  or perhaps being sucked from him.  He felt so hot and so weary.  His mount was struggling to breathe as it ascended a sand dune, then it suddenly de-materialised and Wyl found himself dumped onto the hot sand.  His tongue felt dry and swollen as it swept slowly across his cracked lips.  His vision was blurred and he was confused.  Where was the oasis?  He scrambled to the top of the dune in a panic.  Ah, there it was.  He stumbled on, feeling as if the sun was burning a hole into his head.  He tripped and fell.  He found himself entangled in a pile of dry bones and pitted armour.  He stood wearily to look upon the fallen warrior and found there were the remains of three, around a long dead camp-fire.  Perhaps they had accepted their fate and just joined together in a final meal, before the desert dried their bones?  Wyl fell to his knees, vehemently wishing he could extinguish the sun!  Was this it?  Was this the end?  How ironic, that he should die here in this baking dessert!  He slumped into a sweaty heap, eyes closed, mouth parched.  He thought of home, a place of permanent snow and frost.  He thought then of the day he left.


He had known her for most of his life, yet they stood together in awkward silence, looking along the frozen dirt road to Kharanos and beyond.  The incessant Coldridge wind wailed its goodbyes, while the snow flurries swirled around them, as if urging them back together. He looked at her pretty white face, an icy jewel in a white frozen landscape.  Their frosted breaths danced and mingled until the wind tore them away.
"Please don't leave," she begged tearfully.
He found no words fit to say.  He felt his resolve begin to weaken, but he let his welling tears freeze over before they rose past his heart.  He set his jaw and reset his gaze along the road out of the valley.  He wondered to himself, why, in a land so cold, she offered no warmth, only her pain.
"Goodbye," he said, as he turned and walked away towards Kharanos, without ever daring to look back.


No! He would not die here in this dessert of the forsaken!  When his time came, he would lay down his bones where they belonged, beneath the permafrost.  He concentrated hard and cast Blink.  The oasis did appear a little closer.  He walked slowly towards it and it seemed to get no nearer.  He cast Blink again; yes, it was closer, but his manna was too low to get him there.  Then he remembered the Seven Leaf Clover.
He took it from his backpack, “Well Krackle, you did say it would make a little luck go a long way!”
He cast Blink once more.  It worked! He was standing beneath the shade of a palm, respite at last from the relentless sun.  A freshwater spring burbled at the centre of a small pool.  He waded in and scooped handfuls of the cool water into his mouth and let the refreshing water trickle over his face.  He sat in the pool, momentarily underwater, then sprang up feeling much revived.  He then sloshed out of the water up to the house.


Even close-up, it still shimmered.  He recognized it for what it was; a dream house; an enchanter's snare; a place of illusions, where the magics and physics of the real world no longer applied. If he were not very careful, he would remain captivated by some sweet delight within the dream house and never leave. His real body would wither and rot, while his soul became a figment of the dream for evermore. But he must enter, for somewhere within the dream house lay the object of his quest. He rummaged through his backpack and pulled out an alarm clock. He set the alarm to go off in one hour, dream-time, then popped it back into his backpack.
As he reached for the doors, they swung slowly inward of their own accord.  Wyl stepped cautiously into the cool hallway and stood still for a moment, as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom.  The only sounds were the distant ghostly echoes of children laughing, like innocents lost in limbo.
 The double doors at the far end of the hallway swung open to reveal a beautiful and elegant lady. Her lips were red and full, her eyes were brilliant blue. Her strawberry-blonde hair hung past her shoulders. Her gently heaving bosom drew attention to her hour-glass figure.
"Time is a thief," she said darkly, with a trace of sadness in her voice, "Inexorable, irreversible and stealthier than any rogue.  It takes from us all of the things we hold most dear.  Most unforgivably, it takes from us the people we love."
“How true.”
"You feel a deep sense of loss, in your heart.  A lost love?  What happened to her?"
"Last I heard, she was running the orphanage in Stormwind."
"Laudable."
"Mmmm, but what a price for such a bright mind and brave heart to pay."
"The children must need her care."
"Yes and she will set them off on their way in the wide world, while for her, the whole of Azeroth lies undiscovered."
“She made her choice.”
“Yes, she did.”
“And you made yours.”
“Yes.”
The lady smiled and her demeanour lightened, "Please do come,” she said, “we can talk in the garden."
She spun effortlessly around and the sunlight cascading through the ornate windows caressed her, as she swept majestically along. Wyl could do nought but follow.
"So, you have the tongue of my former husband," she said in a matter of fact tone, but with a cheeky sideways glance.
Wyl was startled by her foreknowledge, but kept his composure, "Indeed."
She giggled, "You know, he used to say that I had a wicked tongue!"
"Surely, you jest," Wyl laughed nervously.
A large wooden door swung open before them and they strolled out into a rose garden. Amongst the roses stood many life-size statues of people: mariners, warriors and others. They continued walking beneath the rose-arbour. The scents and colours in the dappled shade were enchanting.
"Jest? Not I sir," she said, smiling as she tilted her head seductively, "Perhaps you came for my tongue too, to make up the pair?"
"Er, well..."
She stopped and inhaled deeply, "Ahh, don't you think the roses smell wonderful."
"Er, yes..."
"I have created many new varieties. I get such joy from bringing a new beauty to the world."
"Here, this is one of my favourite scents," she said, sniffing a bright yellow rose hanging from the column beside her, "Ah.  See what you think of that."
Wyl leant forward and pretended to take a deep breath, suddenly wary lest the rose be a poison trap. "Mmmm, delicious.  You are clearly a very accomplished horticulturist."
They strolled together exploring the beautiful colours, textures and scents of the many and varied varieties within the garden.  Though he hadn't hitherto been interested in rose-growing, her passion and enthusiasm for the subject was infectious.  As they chatted, Wyl sensed a genuine warmth growing between them.  They talked of many things and found common delight in each other's anecdotes.  They found they shared a similar sense of humour that brought much laughter.
As they turned a corner, Wyl saw a small group of intense-blue climbing-roses in the border ahead.  They were twined around a group of stone statues, of children dancing in a circle. "Wow! They are incredible.  How did you get that colour?" he exclaimed.
"Wait until you smell the scent," she said, drawing one of the blue roses to his nose.
Wyl took the rose, but as he breathed its scent, he pricked his thumb on a thorn, "Ouch!"
A small drop of blood ran from his thumb.
"Here, let me," she said.
As she took his thumb between her luscious lips, they looked deep into each other's eyes.
"I... couldn't smell anything," Wyl said.
She sucked hard on his thumb for a moment, then slipped it from her warm, moist mouth.
"I smell the scent of my lost children," she said, with tears forming in her eyes.
The end of Wyl's thumb felt strangely numb. As he looked at it, he could see it had turned to stone, but he felt oddly detached and unalarmed; in fact, he felt slightly intoxicated.
"The statues?"
"Dead, but dreaming."
She held her hand to his cheek, still looking into his eyes, smiling sadly, "Sweet Wyl. We are so alike, you and I, both prisoners of our own dreams.  But is it truly a prison, where one accepts the confines and has no desire to leave?"
"You tricked me."
"You came here of your own free will, because I have something you need.  You knew the risks."
By now his whole arm was stone, "I suppose so."
The creeping fossilization was moving rapidly.  Wyl could barely breathe and his vision was blurred.  And yet he still thought she looked wonderful, all aglow within a charming pinkish haze.
He just managed to whisper, "Rose-coloured spectacles."
She smiled, "I will fulfil all of your deepest desires.  All things are possible within the vortex of our minds; dreams within dreams within dreams."
He blinked and she was gone, leaving only the warmth of her hand on his cheek.
In another moment, the rose garden dissolved into a bright haze... until...


Girl on a swing


  His heart missed a beat when he suddenly saw her; a girl on a swing, his lost love from many years ago. She was still ravishingly beautiful. She looked wise but not old; curvaceous but not heavy.  Time and his heartbeat seemed to slow, to the serene rhythm of her swinging. Her  bodice of silver filigree and delicate white lace hinted at her dark nipples beneath.  With each swing, her full bosom bobbed gently and her gossamer skirt fluttered behind her. Her smooth, olive skin looked edible.  Her full, plum lips were pouted, her eyes were dark and deep. Her nose was petite and cute. Her jet-black hair bobbed in slow motion, atop her swan-like neck, as she reached the zenith and it streamed back from her broad grin, as she arced downward again.  Swing.  Swing.  Swing.  Vivacious and vibrant, she made the enchantress seem plain by comparison.
  Though agog, he managed to stutter, "You're... still as beautiful... as I remember... you."
  "Thank you," she smiled, "I still wear the pendant you gave me, though who knows whether its magic still works, after all this time."
  "You bought it yourself, remember? One of many things I should have done.  I always was useless at buying gifts for you."
  "Well, it reminds me of you. Especially when I am feeling lonely."
  "Lonely? Surely not. You are so beautiful!"
  She slipped from the swing and skipped up to him.  As she brushed a lock of his hair from his forehead, she said, "I have tried others; they're just not you."
  He basked in the unwavering radiance of her smile.  Sensing her hot breath upon his lips, his mouth watered as he thought to kiss her. The old, deep feelings washed through him again, in wave after wave, as they always had whenever he was with her. The surging tide of warmth within him broke into a wide smile, as he pressed against her.
  "Oh beautiful, precious lady. Such sweet, sweet memories."
  "Yes, memories," she whispered breathlessly, as her wet tongue glossed her pouted lips.
  Their sultry gazes locked, they leant imperceptibly slowly together, until they could sense each others lips without actually touching, breathing each others breaths, melting into each others aura.
  "I could linger here for eternity."
  "But this isn't real."
  "I am so sorry, for all those forlorn hopes. You saw them for what they were, long before I did."
  "Goodbye, lovely man."
  "Goodbye, sweet lady."
  For a few moments of wonder filled reverie, he recalled the sensation of falling into the bright knowing that shone from her deep, dark eyes; the honeyed passion of her tender kisses; his soul resting safely in her embrace.
  He knew the dream was taking hold of all his faculties, but, he wondered, would it be so bad, to spend eternity within this dream?
"Oh sweet, sweet lady, how I have missed your heart, beating next to mine."
"We cannot be real though."
"We once shared a dream, perhaps we can share this one."
"Is it open, honest, fine, pure?"
"No.  But I am no longer certain that matters."
"Perhaps we will find such a dream one day," she whispered, with a tearful smile that said it did matter.
His eyes filled with tears too.
Then he felt himself falling away from her.  He could see her speaking, but could not catch her words. She ran towards him, but in slow time, so that they moved further apart.  She removed the pendant and threw it to him.  It twisted and turned through the air in slower and slower motion.  A bright fog swirled around her and she disappeared as he reached out to catch the pendant.


He was falling slowly and dizzily through luminous swirling clouds, for several moments.  Eventually, he fell out of the clouds and landed softly on his hands and knees, atop a warm sandy hill.  The haze cleared, to reveal a vast machine of shining, whirling metal, spread across the broad plain before him, like a great mechanical city. The air hummed and the ground throbbed in rhythm with its awesome dynamics.  He stood up, unsteadily at first, to look around.  Huge pistons thrust this way and that, while massive wheels and cogs spun and meshed.  The roar of the great engine washed through his soul like a mighty sacred river.


He began to notice subtle rhythms and beats; a sublime music that made him want to tap his feet and bob his head in time. He began a cadenced walk toward the mechanistic metropolis, but the walk soon became a joyful dance!
  Very soon, he stood next to a great whirling armature and placed his hand upon the huge metallic beam that supported it. Within the tumult of harmonic vibrations that coursed through his fingertips, he sensed a vague arrhythmia. As he focused on the disharmony, it grew into a cry from within the great machine. It called to his soul; a mournful plea for mechanical healing. His engineer's instincts were already formulating ideas on the cause of the problem. He knew he could fix it. He knew it would need a lot of work; perhaps it would be the work of a lifetime, but he was just the one to do it! It was an engineer's dream. How he wished his father were here with him now; they would work on it together until their knuckles bled oil.
  Then, off in the distance, made hazy by the exhaust gases of the great machine, Wyl could just make out a familiar figure, stooped intently over a stuttering mechanism.
 "Dad? Dad!"
  He ran towards the man, who looked round as he approached and then stood square and tall. The man smiled and held his arms wide open.
"My son! At last, you've come to help me," he said, his voice filled with warmth and gratitude, "I have toiled alone for so long."
Wyl jumped into that strong embrace and was held there, tight and warm as the air throbbed with the thunderous grand opera of the great machine. Wyl felt so at home in that strong embrace. So loved. So cherished. Ding-a-ling. Ding-a-ling. Ding-a-ling. The alarm clock!


He was wrenched painfully from the dream and back to reality. His eyes filled with tears as the vision of his father faded. Instead, he was confronted by the enchantress in her true harpy form. Caught by surprise, she hissed and screeched in rage as she flapped her shimmering feather wings, furiously trying to take off, while slashing at him with her talons.
Her fury was matched by an explosive hatred that fired Wyl into instant action.  He caught her full-on with his Frost Nova and froze her to the spot.  Then he hurled fireball after fireball, seething with a vicious determination to obliterate her!  He realised he still had the pendant in his hand, so he stuffed it into his pack, then grabbed his wand and took aim.  But the harpy was already defeated by the ferocity of his attack.  She lay crumpled on the floor, her beautiful plumage frazzling in the flames.  Seeing her there, broken and twisted, his hatred was extinguished by a flood of remorse at what he had done and how he had felt.  He cast an ice-spell to douse the flames; she lay there steaming and choking, blackened and singed.
She turned her sooty face up to him, with those wide eyes filled with the deep sadness of a mother mourning her children, "Quickly, lay me with my little ones.  Please," she coughed.
Wyl hurriedly cast his trinket levitation spell and lifted her into the rose bower, lowering her gently to the ground.  The roses wrapped around her.  As the thorns bit her flesh, small rivulets of blood ran down to the rich soil.  As her flesh began to crystallize to stone, she heaved a sigh and smiled.
Suddenly, as if from nowhere, the rogue appeared!  With a single swish of her dagger, she cut out the harpy's tongue.
"Did you forget what you came for?" she admonished as she displayed the bloody trophy.
Wyl looked down at the harpy.  Her bloody grimace was set in stone.
"Quick! The jar!" shouted the rogue.
Wyl pulled the jar from his pack and popped up the lid.  The rogue dropped the tongue into the potion and Wyl quickly replaced the lid and put the jar back into his pack.
"And what did you come for?"
"Well, I figured there'd be rich pickings."
"Help yourself," Wyl said dismissively.
"I intend to."
As the rogue wandered back into the house, Wyl stood in a daze, while the recent events tumbled haphazardly through his mind.  He felt physically and emotionally exhausted.  He went in search of somewhere to sleep.  He flopped face down onto the first bed he found, but his whirling brain wouldn't let him sleep.  His journey suddenly seemed pointless.  He now had both tongues, but he didn't feel excited about the prospect of selling them any more.  He just wanted to go home.  Home; where his mother would be worrying about him.  He sat up and rummaged through his pack until he found the Dreamcaster Orb.  He would send his mother a dream, to let her know he was alive and well.  But each time he tried, the images that appeared within the orb were of charred harpies, vampire roses and bloody tongues.  He couldn't send those dreams to his mother.  He looked around the room, at the carved bed frame, the flowery quilt, the ornate windows, the plain walls, a tapestry on the wall which was just an indistinct pattern from where he sat.  Nothing to inspire a pleasant dream.  He almost gave up and was sat there thinking he could do with one of his mum's hugs, when a vision appeared in the glass, of him standing behind his mother and wrapping his arms tight around her.  She sank into him and smiled so warmly.  He smiled back and rested his chin on her shoulder, so they stood cheek to cheek.  The image within the orb swirled and shone brighter as the dream was cast, then it faded back to clear glass.  Wyl returned the orb to his pack and then lay back on the bed, feeling calm and sleepy now.  As his eyelids grew heavy, he made a mental note to give his mum a real hug, the next time he saw her.


The pleasant images of home faded as he fell into a fitful sleep.  He dreamt he was free-falling into a bottomless shaft; twisting into nether darkness.  The face of the rogue swam before him, coming and going as he kept spinning around and ever downward.
She kept repeating the same words over and over, "You go on your way and I'll go mine.  You go on your way and I'll go mine.  You go on your way and I'll go mine."
And all the while, he could hear the familiar echoes of a pick clanging on hard rock.
Then the face of the rogue was replaced by the face of the old witch, Eweline, at their last meeting in her old queerly angled house.
"And what other profession have you chosen?" she quizzed.
"Jewel-crafting."
She looked down her long nose with that piercing gaze for which she is renowned, "Mmmm, gnomes are not noted for their skill with gems.  Your engineering is entirely appropriate, but, jewel-crafting?  I sense... a penance, for some error."
"Penance?" he sighed wistfully, "I live in hope that I'll get the chance to make good my error."
"Ah, missed chances.  Don't let them cloud fresh opportunities, young mage.  I sense there is much good in you.  Sow it liberally, then it will grow abundantly around you."
“Perhaps.  I sometimes wish I could erase the past and start again.”
“The past is already erased, young mage.  We each have our imperfect memories of it, but they are all that remains.”
“Nevertheless, I am unhappy with the future to which my past has brought me.”
“You seek a new future?”
“Yes.”
“You have such regrets?”
“Yes.  No, actually, no, not regrets;  I am cursed.”
“Cursed?”
“By an undying love.”
“I see.  Well then, perhaps I have an errand that might help you find a cure...”


Suddenly the dream changed; Wyl and Eweline were standing together in the garden of the enchantress, surrounded by the statues of the lost children and the parasitic roses.  Eweline held a Dreamcaster Orb in her hand, "Listen carefully Wyl."
Wyl looked at her stern face.
"You must go on, further west.  The errand is not yet done."
"I want to go home."
"Take heart.  What you do is a good thing and I chose you with care, for this is a very important task.  Leave the Isle of Disenchantment and cross the westward strait to the far coast."
"But, I have the tongue you wanted.  In fact, I have the pair."
"I didn't say I wanted the tongues."
"Oh, yes, that's right.  The leprechaun didn't want it either."
"It is you who needs the tongues.  Go west, young mage.  All will become clear.  Take care."
"But..." Wyl began to respond but his feet felt wet so he looked down.  The garden was filling with water!  He looked up, but Eweline was gone.
Suddenly, Wyl awoke, lying on the bed and staring at the ceiling, "Ah, just a dream."
But then he realised he really was wet.  He sat bolt upright.  The room really was filling with water.  He jumped off the bed and waded out of the house.  The sea was returning!  The nearest boat to the house was a three masted frigate.  He summoned his mount and raced towards it.
