<h1 class="chapterHeading">ROGUE</h1>

<p class="intro">
The next morning was damp and misty, with the clouds threatening rain.  Wyl awoke early, feeling chilled,
while the sleeping fairies strewn around dreamed on.
</p>

<p>
Wyl got dressed and then ate some of his Shroom Bread for breakfast, noting once again that it seemed to soothe his broken heart.
Then with a gentle peck on the cheek of the slumbering queen and a silent wave to his new friends among the Corioli,
he strode quietly out of the glade, mounted up, and with a wistful look back, rode reluctantly up and over the western ridge.
</p>

<p>
After a slow couple of hours of fairly dense forest, the trees thinned suddenly to a shoreline of dunes
and coarse tufted grasses.  Wyl trotted out onto a small promontory overlooking a misty bay.
He dismissed his mount and stood for several minutes looking out onto <em class="place">The Sea of Dreams</em>.
</p>

<p>
Then, the <em class="spell">Ring of Prescience</em>, on the little finger of his left hand, began to tremble.
He looked deep into the large blue gem atop the ring, at the swirling clouds within. The mists cleared to reveal
the scene behind him; a pack of sentient rodents scurried about in the half-light beneath the trees,
preparing their weapons and positioning for an attack.
</p>

<p>
Wyl spun around and cast his <em class="spell">Frost Armour</em> spell, even as a flock of their arrows arched toward him.
As they struck him, they froze and shattered into harmless powdered snow. Striding forward,
he cast <em class="spell">Arcane Missiles</em> at the ringleader with one hand, as he pulled his wand from his belt with the other.
The residual supernatural static flickered amongst them, making them dance and laugh like ticklish drunken revellers.
With a flick of the wrist he flung <em class="spell">Fireball</em> at the group; it exploded among them setting their fur alight
and causing screams and panic.   The attackers had had enough already and they turned to flee back into the forest.
It was barely a fight at all and Wyl was left wondering idly when he would ever get to exercise his wand.
He quickly cast a <em class="spell">Frost Nova</em> spell on one of the laggards,
freezing him to the spot. The rest soon vanished, leaving their luckless comrade to his fate.
</p>

<p>
Wyl sauntered up to the captive, who shivered with the cold of the spell, but with fear too.
Wyl unhitched his backpack and rifled through it until he pulled out the <em class="spell">Eye of Remembering</em>.
He looked at the squishy eyeball within its nest of flesh and hair.
As always, it looked as if it had been freshly torn from the head of its owner.
It shed tears constantly, for it could never forget anything it had ever seen.
Were they tears of sorrow or tears of joy? Who could know and stay sane with the knowledge?
He quickly closed his hand over it, for he felt its insight stirring within his mind and as he knew only too well,
it had a penchant for revealing memories you would rather forget.
In any case, he had another subject for its examinations, one who was rapidly thawing.
</p>

<p>
He held the eye before the cowering rodent. The creature's feeble intelligence offered no resistance to the mental probing.
A stream of memories and sensations tumbled into Wyl's mind, spinning backwards through time;
sights, sounds, feelings; the full gamut of experience as the rodent had recently lived it; of the attack, the stalking,
the packs early morning journey through the forest. Then, Wyl found what he sought; the captive was being berated by a
particularly large and vicious looking ogre, beside a jetty with small boats - just what he needed to continue his journey.
From the knowledge of the eye he knew where they were and how to get there. He put the eye back into his pack.
Though the freezing spell had worn-off, the rodent hadn't yet realized and stood in a daze.
<br/>"Begone!" shouted Wyl, pointing the way with his wand.
</p>

<p>
Wyl watched the rodent scurry into the forest as fast as his legs could carry him,
while he mused on the deeper sadnesses the Eye had revealed within the mind of the rodent:
Why am I always slower than the rest?  Why is everyone cleverer than me?  Why did mum never want to hug me?
Wyl conjured his mount and saddled-up.
Then he trotted along the southern shore into the thickening mists, wondering - why is it always 'why'?
</p>

<p>
Within the hour, Wyl arrived at the small fishing village on the bay.
It was surrounded by a simple wooden palisade and had but one watchtower.
Wyl knew it well, because the rodent whose memories he had stolen had grown up there.
Even the smell of rotting fish wafting across seemed strangely comforting.
The village was nothing more than a loose cluster of wooden huts around a rickety dock.
The rodent villagers were going about their daily business.
Wyl thought it would be difficult to just steal a boat without being seen and that a plan was called for.
</p>

<p>
He searched his backpack, looking for something to distract or quiesce the entire village.
He had various dream philtres and sleeping potions, but it would be nigh impossible to drug everyone without being discovered.
<br />He mumbled to himself as he rummaged, "Mmm, <em class="spell">The Key to the Chastity Belt of the Thousand Year Virgin</em>, never going to finish that quest," and tossed the key into the mud.
<br />"<em class="spell">Century Slumber Dust</em>. Seems a little harsh to put them all to sleep for a hundred years just to borrow a boat."
<br />"<em class="spell">Burnt Midnight Oil</em>. Ah, now that could do the trick," he whispered, swishing the dark fluid in the small, stoppered vial.
</p>

<p>
He looked up into the grey misty sky.
The sun wasn't visible through the thick scudding clouds, but Wyl reckoned it must be a couple of hours to sunset.
He found himself a dry spot and sat cross-legged amongst some tall, thick grasses.
As he wondered how he would subdue the village, his mind wandered, to that place it often did when his mind was unfocused,
to the deep, dark eyes of the girl who lay within his heart; to her warm embrace; to their final kiss; to their last goodbye
and that wonderful smile he hadn't realised he was seeing for the very last time.  He fell into a doze and dreamt of walking
with her hand in hand, through a pleasant land of green and gentle hills.
</p>

<p>
He awoke with a shiver as a rivulet of cold rain trickled down his back. As his eyes focussed,
the face of another formed before him; dark smouldering eyes looked out from between a shock of black hair and a red bandanna
that masked the nose and mouth.  Wyl quickly took a firm grip on his staff, <em class="spell">Dawning Wood</em>, and tensed for action...
but the stranger made no move.
<br />After a few moments, Wyl spoke, "Good evening, rogue."
<br />The stranger spoke quietly but deeply, with a thick gutter accent that seemed slightly affected, "Good evening, mage.
Careless of you to fall asleep."
<br />"I sleep to dream."
<br />"Then she must be a rare delight indeed. You are lucky to carry such a glow within your heart.
Many yearn for such a dream, but merely sleep alone.  But, to business; I have a certain task to perform
tonight in yonder village and I just wanted to make certain you and I are not going to get in each other's way."
<br />"I also have a task in the village."
<br />"Well, we could duel for the privilege, but that might attract unwanted attention."
<br />"Most definitely."
<br />"What is it you want in the village?"
<br />"I want to steal a boat."
<br />"Well, if that is all you want, we should have no quarrel.
But, the village isn't as defenceless as it would first appear. It is the base for the local bandits."
<br />"Yes, I know. They tried to ambush me earlier today."
<br />"I see.  Then clearly you know how to handle yourself in a fight.
Perhaps we can work together. I intend to collect the bounty on the head of their leader, Janmuri the Ogre.
Of course, I also expect to help myself to their booty, but I could be persuaded to share."
<br />"I agree collaboration would make the venture less risky for us both; I really have no need of anything but the boat."
<br />The rogue shrugged, "As you wish. My plan was to quietly dispose of the sentries and then sneak into Janmuri's hut,
assassinate him and his henchmen, loot the place and then sneak away. Unfortunately, when I scouted the place earlier
I noticed he has a hellboar pet, which will smell me coming a mile off and wake the whole village."
<br />"Mmmm, well my plan was to cast a nightmare curse diversion and steal a boat during the pandemonium.
I was wondering how to get close to the centre of the village to cast the curse on a suitable subject or two.
But, now you're here, I have an idea."
<br />Despite the mask, Wyl could tell the rogue smiled knowingly.
<br />"Yes," Wyl smiled back, "I will give you the agent of the curse. You can sneak in and curse the hellboar with it.
It will sleep deeply, but all of it's worst nightmares will be projected into the real world for a few minutes.
Only the gods can guess what phantasms of the fiery pit that creature will unleash upon the poor villagers!"
<br />They both chuckled mischievously.
<br />The rogue stood up, shaking off the raindrops, "The village has been quiet for a while, so we may as well get this over with.
Then I can can get some sleep too."
<br />Then the rain stopped and the clouds broke to reveal a gibbous moon that painted the ramshackle dwellings with a wan light.
<br />"No matter," whispered the rogue, looking skyward, "I'll use stealth."
</p>

<p>
Wyl collected his things and waited for the rogue to give the word, then they crept down to a spot by the palisade and hid from the
watchtower beneath a thick pall of smoke still rising slowly from the smoking-shed. As Wyl followed the rogue, he observed a smooth
graceful movement and some fine feminine curves through the dark leather cuirass.
<br />"You're a girl!"
<br />The rogue spun around quickly and put her hand on the hilt of the brutal looking dagger at her waist.
<br />"And what of it?!" she said in a stage whisper.
<br />"Oh, nothing. But you were pretending to be a man."
<br />"In my line of work, one uses many disguises."
<br />"I suppose."
<br />"Let's get on."
<br />Wyl handed the vial to the rogue, "Pour the oil onto some tasty morsel and lob it at the hellboar. There is enough for about ten minutes of nightmare.
Ignore the nightmare phantoms, they will appear terrifying, but are harmless wisps. I will come in when I hear the screams."
<br />The rogue slipped the vial into her waistband and nodded, "Thank you."
<br />"By the way, I am Wyl of Ironford. Who are you?"
<br />"I?" her fading whisper was suddenly silkily feminine as she melted into the shadows, "I?  I am the footfalls beneath your feet;
I am the shade in the moon shadow; I am the kiss of the quick blade; I am the name on your final breath..."
<br />Wyl stood very still and waited a few moments in silence, unsure at first that she had gone and strangely entranced by her final,
somewhat theatrical whisperings. But then his rumbling stomach and the smell of kippers smoking reminded him how long it had been since breakfast.
If there was gold to be had, the rogue could keep it, he determined to loot himself some supper. He took his wand from his belt and listened intently.
</p>

<p>
The minutes passed with just the sound of the lapping waves, until Wyl heard an agitated high pitched squeaking,
which he took to be the screams of frightened rodents.  He used his <em class="spell">Plume of the Fan-Dancer</em> trinket,
to levitate over the palisade and set-down just the other side, sniggering as he recalled the quest he had completed to obtain that particular trinket.
There was no sign of the rogue, but terrified rodents were scurrying in all directions,  their eyes bulging with fear.
Wyl ran past the smoking-shed, through the commotion and into the centre of the village, where he came to a sudden halt.
He could see the nightmare conjured by the hellboar; it was a thirty foot high hellboar sow.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the rogue appeared, "I don't think that is the hellboar's nightmare; more like a wish come true, if the size of the mammaries are anything to go by!"
<br />"Well, it seems to be working."
<br />"But not quite as advertised; I just saw three rodents crushed to death beneath those mighty breasts.  That is no mere phantasm!"
<br />"And it's headed this way!" cried Wyl in alarm.
<br />"Run!  No! This way!  To the ogre!" commanded the rogue.
<br />They skirted around the nearby huts until they were behind the huge sow.  Sure enough, the sow careened through a hut ahead of it and smashed it flat.
The horrible squeals from within the collapsing hut didn't last long.
<br />"Where did you get that oil?  Booty Bay?"
<br />"Not sure.  Darkmoon Faire, I think."
<br />"Aha!  That'll teach you."
</p>

<p>
Then, bang!  Something heavy hit Wyl very hard on the back of the head and he was stunned.
As he spun around in a daze, he saw Janmuri the Ogre raising his wooden club to attack the rogue.
The rogue dodged the clumsy swipe and struck the ogre in the ribs with a swift stab of her savage looking dagger.
The ogre staggered and roared, but quickly raised his club again.  Wyl tried to cast a <em class="spell">Frost Nova</em> spell but was still incapacitated by the stun.
Two more ogres appeared, henchmen of Janmuri.  They crowded around the rogue and all three rained down blows while she did her best to duck and dive.
But a couple of glancing blows landed.  Even so, Wyl saw her dip her blade in poison as she rolled away from another vicious swing.  She lunged at one of the
henchmen and stuck the poison blade in his fat belly even as the club of Janmuri whooshed just over her head.  Then, the other henchman caught her with a
heavy blow and she was knocked backwards.  Janmuri turned to Wyl and lifted his club to strike, but Wyl shook himself out of his dazed state and cast <em class="spell">Blink</em>,
reappearing twenty yards behind Janmuri, who looked dumbly around for the vanished mage.  Wyl cast <em class="spell">Frost Nova</em> and the
feet of Janmuri were fixed within blocks of ice.  Janmuri had made the mistake of turning his back on the rogue; she dodged a swing by one of the henchmen to step up behind Janmuri
and deliver a powerful backstab with her poison blade.  Janmuri sagged beneath the blow.  By now the poisoned henchman was turning green and clutching his throat.
Wyl fired <em class="spell">Arcane Missiles</em> at the other henchman just as he took aim at the rogue, and knocked him off his stride.
The rogue twisted around and stabbed the lethal blade into his belly.  Wyl launched a <em class="spell">Fireball</em> at each of the ogres in turn.
The first poisoned henchman dropped to the ground with a loud thud.  The rogue now had a garotte around the throat of Janmuri and administered the kill as Wyl finished the other
henchman with another blistering <em class="spell">Fireball</em>.  By the time the fires stopped crackling,  three charred ogres lay still on the scorched earth.
</p>

<p>
Wyl looked around for the sow.  He could see it rampaging across the other side of the village, most of which was now splintered wood.
<br />The rogue quickly looted the three ogre corpses, "Here, Janmuri has something I don't need."
<br />Wyl stooped to collect the loot the rogue had left him; a small bottle of bright blue liquid, which had a single golden glyph embossed upon it.
<br />"Come, the dock is this way," said the rogue.
They both ran along the rickety dock to the nearest sailing dinghy.  They clambered in and the rogue pushed them away from the dock, then took up the oars.
Wyl looked back to the shattered village.  The rodents were still in a panic, though it looked as if the hellboar sow had returned to the land of hellboar dreams.
Wyl felt pity for the rodents.
<br />"We did them a favour," said the rogue, "They can rebuild their village and there will be no ogres to boss them around."
<br />"I guess so," said Wyl, somewhat dismayed at the destruction and not entirely convinced that there weren't plenty of other ogres to take their place.
</p>

<p>
As they rowed further out onto the sea, Wyl hoisted the sail and took the tiller and mainsheet as the rogue stowed the oars.
The craft was soon running smoothly out of the bay on a steady beam reach, making for an easy sail.
<br />"Head around the headland and then we'll beach until morning," said the rogue.
<br />Wyl did as the rogue suggested and they were soon hauling the dinghy into a small deserted inlet.
</p>

<p>
As the rogue investigated the small beach and the nearby cliffs, Wyl looked again at the bottle he had looted from Janmuri.  The glyph looked familiar.
Then he recalled the crystal in his backpack.  He rummaged around until he found it; it looked lacklustre and neglected, but sure enough it bore the inverse imprint of the
same embossed glyph.  Wyl felt guilty as he looked at it.  He put the bottle together with the crystal so the glyph images aligned and slotted together.
A puff of purple smoke rose from the crystal and formed a vision before him.
</p>

<p>
He saw an ancient white-haired alchemist with a long white beard, working busily over a hissing, burbling tangle of glass and copper apparatus.
<br />The alchemist looked up, "Welcome stranger... ah, Wyl, is that you?"
<br />Wyl said sheepishly, "Yes, it is I."
<br />"So, you still have the <em class="spell">Soul-link</em>?"
<br />"Yes."
<br />"It's been a long time, my friend."
<br />"Yes it has. I'm sorry."
<br />After a brief moment of awkward silence, the alchemist smiled.
<br />"So, you are wondering upon the nature of my work? It is the Elixir of Eternal Boyhood you possess. One of my finest potions, perfected over many years.
Think carefully, before you use it. Surely, it will keep you young in mind and in body, until the end of thy natural term, such is its purpose.
It will strip you of the weighty obligations of manhood. All feelings of responsibility will vanish, along with all the pain of failing to meet the expectations of others.
Truly, thy life will be carefree for a time, filled full with play and petty dreams.  But be warned, you will lose your manly wisdom and every remembrance from which it has been forged.
You will forget all of thy deepest sorrows and all of thy most precious memories.  You will have no recollection of the warm glint in the eyes of thy one true love;
who knew you to be a real man.  All thine acts of bravery, be they writ large or small upon the world, shall be unwoven from the fabric of time.
You will remain haunted by the childish fears you can never outgrow.  And when the end of your days arrives, there will be no sparkling diamonds shining proudly,
from amidst the bitter ashes of thy many disasters.  You will count your life cheap, for what is the worth of a life filled with dreams you never had the courage to live?
It is your choice; be a boy, or be a man."
<br />"An odd thing for an old ogre to possess," said Wyl.
<br />"Not really, even old ogres hanker after the adventures of their boyhood."
<br />"And old alchemists?"
<br />"They do sometimes... and sometimes... they drink too many potions for their own good."
<br />"I'm sorry I didn't get in touch."
<br />"The river flows faster than any of us realize."
<br />"I need your help now, if you don't mind?"
<br />"Of course not, my friend.  How may I help you?"
<br />"I'm lost and don't know how to find my way;  the sky above me is dark.  I remember the stars always shone for you."
<br />"Ah, then allow me."
<br />The alchemist looked up and waved his arm as if presenting the heavens.  The clouds were swept away by his gesture, to reveal a bright panoply of twinkling stars.
<br />"There," said the alchemist, pointing, "Just follow that bright star near the horizon."
<br />"Thank you, old friend, I will come visit, I promise."
<br />"Nay, Wyl, my flask lies cold and empty, beyond the plane of life.  I exist now only as the fading fragments of your memories.  Live well, old friend."
<br />The vision faded before Wyl, as tears filled his eyes.
</p>

<p class="expand">
TRAVEL BY NIGHT _ GUIDED BY STARS
</p>

<p class="intro">
Again came the morning and the familiar heartache, but the Shroom Bread was gone and so, apparently, was the rogue.
<br/>"Are you stealthed again? I wish you wouldn't do that!" Wyl cried out.
<br/>But there was a reply, faint with distance and hard to discern for a moment, until Wyl's brain formulated, "You go on your way; I'll go mine."
<br/>He called inland, to the rogue, "Farewell then.  I must cross the sea."
<br/>Wyl waited for a few moments but no reply came.
<br/>"At least the sun is shining," he mumbled to himself as he watched the reflections glitter on the sea.
</p>
<p>
He soon had the dinghy relaunched and sailed steadily without event, for a few hours.  During the afternoon, storm clouds began to gather ahead.  As the wind picked up the sky grew heavy with dark undulatus.
</p>
<p>
Wyl hove-to and let out the main-sheet to wait-out the storm.  He lay back in the rocking boat, feeling a little sleepy despite the pitching.  Then, he thought he heard a whisper, over the sound of wind and water.  Then again, a single word.  He strained to hear it clearly.  It was repeated but he still couldn't make it out.
<br/>"Rogue?  Is that you?"
The whispering became more frequent, but was still barely audible.  Wyl sat up slowly and looked about, yet there was nothing to see around the boat apart from the dark water.
Gradually though, as his eyes became accustomed to the gloom, he made out a shoal of hippocampi swimming around the dinghy.  It seemed very odd, but they were definitely circling the boat.
And the longer he watched them, the more convinced he became, that it was these little seahorses that were whispering!
Wyl was so intent on making out what they were saying, that he even held his breath.
He could just begin to make out a word, "… whirls ..."
He leant further out, to hear better the tiny voices, "… little whirls ..."
They were repeating the same rhythmic chant over and over, so very quietly.
<br/>"Big whirls ... little whirls ... lesser whirls ..."
<br/>"Yes!" Wyl shouted in triumph when he got it:
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Fry_Richardson">
Big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity,
<br/>And little whirls have lesser whirls and so on to vorticity.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
The susurration went on and on, as the tiny, sparkling school maintained an unbroken slowly spinning circle around the boat, without change in tempo or amplitude.
Then Wyl became aware that the boat was moving, somehow propelled by the circulating action of the shoal.  Or was it?  Wyl's sense of space and time had become confused.
He felt a little dizzy.  He tipped back his head to take a deep breath and was shocked to see stars whizzing around the sky like sparks from a catherine wheel!
Day had become night! The whole celestial arc was spinning rapidly, as if the boat was turning fast beneath it.
The seahorse whispering continued on and on; the stars were moving so fast now, that the blackness of the night sky was coloured-in with the brightness of the stellar streaks,
until the whole of the heavenly dome was bright with starlight!  Wyl felt a lightness in the pit of his stomach, as if he was being propelled downward at some incredible speed.
The dizziness increased until he swooned into a fitful dream.
</p>
<p>
Boyhood; that is where the dream took him, standing at the open door to the classroom of his Master of Magics, who sat at his desk talking sternly to a senior girl pupil.
<br/>He beckoned Wyl to enter, "Come in and take a seat for a moment Wyl," said the Grand Wizard.
<br/>Wyl took a seat by the door in the otherwise empty classroom.
<br/>The Grand Wizard turned his attention back to the other pupil, "It can't be done with positive energy density everywhere.  The causality violations appear in a finite region
of space-time without curvature singularities.  There will be a light-like boundary that is compactly generated and that contains one or more closed null geodesics which will be incomplete.
If the causality violation developed from a non-compact initial surface, the averaged weak energy condition must be violated on the horizon."
<br/>The girl seemed only momentarily rebuffed before she mustered a confident response,"That does not rule out the possibility of non-compactly generated horizons or regions which contain exotic matter,
not to mention quantum gravity!"
The Grand Wizard sighed resignedly, "Okay Phillipah, I look forward to reading that paper once you have the theory fully developed.  In the meantime, would you please do me the courtesy of doing the homework as set and
returning it on time.  No more excuses! "
<br/>Wisely, the girl bit her lip.
<br/>"Thank you," said the Grand Wizard, "That will be all."
<br/>The girl spun around and left.
</p>
<p>
The Grand Wizard raised his eyes to the ceiling, then looked at Wyl and smiled, "Don't look so worried, young Wyl.  I asked you to stay behind because you show such exceptional promise.
In fact, I think you're ready for some extra lessons.  I want to introduce you to a new teacher; a teacher who will broaden and deepen your knowledge in ways that the normal curriculum here doesn't offer.
Of course, it would mean extra work.  Are you interested?"
<br/>"Er, yes.  Thank you, Grand Wizard."
<br/>"Good.  Now then, there is something else I must do first.  But please come with me, you may find this educational too."
</p>

<p>
The Grand Wizard stood and conjured a portal.
<br/>"Come," he said as he stepped through.
<br/>Wyl followed immediately.  They stepped out onto a large neat lawn surrounded by tall clipped hedges and adjacent to a rambling country mansion.
A few people lay on the grass here and there, soaking up the warm evening sunshine.  A night-elf in a white coat noticed their appearance and walked over to meet them.
<br/>"Good evening, Grand Wizard," she said as she dipped her head slightly in deference.
<br/>"Good evening, Doctor.  This is Wyl, one of my most accomplished students."
<br/>"Welcome, Wyl," said the doctor.
<br/>"Good evening," said Wyl.
<br/>"I am so glad you could attend today, Grand Wizard.  I am afraid the patient's condition is deteriorating as predicted."
<br/>"Oh dear.  May I see her?"
<br/>"Certainly.  This way please."
<br/>As they followed the doctor across the lawn, the Grand Wizard explained in hushed tones, "This, young mage, is a place neither you or I would wish to end up."
<br/>"It's a hospital?"
<br/>"Sort of.  This is The Institute of Magical Health.  These patients you see here are all suffering from a very serious condition.
At one time they were all mages, sorcerers, witches, warlocks... that is, people of pronounced magical ability.  But now, they have lost all sense of magic.  They no-longer believe in magic.
They have lost all touch with reality."
<br/>"They're all mad?"
<br/>"Utterly.  Sad isn't it?  Imagine yourself, entirely cut-off from your inner spirit, without your keen sense of wonder in the magical nature of the world."
<br/>Wyl shuddered at the thought. "Is there no cure?"
<br/>"The doctors here work tirelessly in search of one.  But, none has yet been discovered.  There are some promising avenues of research.
For example, a recent study has shown that certain love philtres stimulate a very weak and temporary belief in magic.  One theory, that is very much in vogue, is that true love,
the real thing and not some apothecary's simulation, would indeed cure the afflicted.  However, the critics of the theory claim that one has to believe in magic to ever fall in love.
This topic will be hotly debated for some time yet, I fear."
</p>
<p>
"Here she is, Grand Wizard," said the doctor, as she pointed out a frumpy old woman sat on a wooden bench.  She was sitting still and relaxed with a distant, vacant stare.
<br/>"Thank you, doctor.  Wyl, allow me to introduce my wife, The Great Golden Sorceress of the Seven Golden Dawns."
<br/>"Oh, hello dear," said the twee little woman to Wyl.  "Take no notice of him," she winked, "he's a bit loopy!"
<br/>"My dear," said the Grand Wizard, "your shoelace is undone."
<br/>"Oh my, so it is." said the woman, as she stooped to tie it.
<br/>Wyl and the Grand Wizard watched her struggle to tie the lace for several minutes.
<br/>Then the Grand Wizard stooped and kissed her on the cheek, "Goodbye, my dear," he said sadly as he turned and motioned Wyl and the doctor to follow him.
<br/>"You see? Once upon a time she would have just snapped her fingers.  I hope this hasn't upset you, young mage.  Your coming of age is near, so it is as well you should see something of the wider world, warts and all."
<br/>The Grand Wizard conjured another portal and turned to the doctor, "Thank you, doctor.  Please make her as comfortable as you can.  Goodbye."
<br/>Then he turned to Wyl, "Come, I shall now introduce you to someone who is in full command of all her magical faculties.  Of that, there is no doubt."
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, the dreaming sleep ended, as, with an involuntary groan, Wyl leant over starboard and wretched only air and saliva, his eyes screwed tight with the pain of the convulsions.
As the spasms subsided, he raised his head and squinted through his tears.  He was astonished to find himself looking at dry sunlit sand, rather than dark water!  He sat up quickly and looked around.
He was still in the boat, but the boat lay in a sandy desert!  In fact, the weathered coral-encrusted rocks nearby indicated straight away that this was a dried up seabed!
Casting his gaze farther afield, Wyl was further amazed by what he saw.  The sands were littered with the crumbling abandoned hulks of boats and ships of all kinds, from small boats like his, to yachts to frigates to galleons.
It looked like a ship graveyard and it stretched for miles.  There was no sign of the multitude of sailors that must have piloted these vessels, to this world bereft of sea; not even a vacant skull or a rusty cutlass.
He felt a deep foreboding; this place, was a last resting place.
</p>
<p>
He stepped from the boat and began to walk towards a rocky outcrop that he hoped would provide a vantage point.  The air was hot, dry and dusty.
He conjured a pouch of fresh spring water and took a few swigs as he walked, relishing the buzz as the manna revitalised his wizardly powers.
As he approached the base of the outcrop, his feet crunched upon the bleached bones of fishes.
For a split second, Wyl envisaged the fish crowded together in the rock-pool in the shade of the promontory, gasping as the last vestige of a once mighty ocean dwindled away beneath an unforgiving sun.
He tried to think no more about it as he passed over them.  He scrambled up the side of the rocky outcrop, gaining easy purchase on the ancient corals, but reaching the flat top sweaty and out of breath.
He stood to look around.  The ancient seabed stretched unbroken in all directions except for where it met a ridge of sheer cliffs in one direction and, in the opposite direction, some way off, where there appeared to be an oasis.
He looked again at the cliffs, then back at the oasis, thinking every sailor before him must have chosen the oasis.  What sirens might he find there?
Perhaps this was the final destination of every sailor on the seas of fate?  Perhaps this was his final destination?  Perhaps this was the Isle of Disenchantment?
He scrambled back down from the rock, summoned his mount and set off toward the oasis.
