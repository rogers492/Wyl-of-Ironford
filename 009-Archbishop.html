<p class="intro">
Wyl looked across the fire towards the Black Citadel, which he couldn't quite place in the darkness, though distant lights burned in that direction.
He began to feel nervous.  As questions tumbled through his mind, about why he was here and what might happen the following day, he felt a tiny fluttering within,
as if the stains of past sins were being gently cleansed from his soul.  He turned to look into the kindly gaze of the Archbishop.
He sensed an aura of forgiveness emanating from a big heart and saw there a genuine love for all souls, both good and bad.
<br/>"Peace be thine," said the Archbishop softly, as he made the sign of the blessing.
<br/>"Thank you, Your Grace," said Wyl.
<br/>The Archbishop looked to the horizon and Wyl turned to follow his gaze.
<br/>The Archbishop spoke quietly but clearly, "The Black Citadel."
<br/>"Yes," whispered Wyl.
<br/>"It's thousands of years old.  It has been the base of many a tyrant, even before the unholy Arcanist took up residence there, just over two hundred years ago.
History records only two sorcerers who ever entered the Black Citadel and resisted its baleful influence, for a while at least.  They succumbed eventually."
<br/>"Really?  They must have been very powerful.  Who were they?"
<br/>"My son, you are much better acquainted with them than I," said the Archbishop as he patted Wyl's backpack."
<br/>"Oh! You mean..."
<br/>"Yes. Their hearts were once filled with the divine light of love."
<br/>The Archbishop placed his hands gently upon Wyl's shoulders and looked deep into his eyes.
<br/>"Our scryers have foretold of another."
<br/>"Not Me?"
<br/>"Yes, you."
<br/>"I can't... really, I can't."
<br/>"Yes you can.  You have the heart for it.  Together with the knowledge and the power..."
<br/>"I don't! How could I defeat the unholy Arcanist alone?"
<br/>"My son, you will never be alone, you are deeply loved," said the Archbishop with a gentle smile.
<br/>"But, what knowledge? What power?"
<br/>"Ah, yes.  The knowledge I shall impart to you now, and the power that knowledge brings.
The Black Citadel is actually built upon the site of an even older temple.  Yogg Sothoth is the name the ancient elves used for it.
It has many names in many tongues.  Its true name is unspeakable, not that any mortal should dare to utter it.
It means: The Gate to the Dreaming Place of the Great Old Ones.  It is older than Azeroth itself; a projection from an unholy dimension.
It houses a portal, between the dimensions, that has lain dormant for aeons.  It is said that even the unholy Arcanist himself, shudders at what lies beyond that portal.
But, he draws on its fel-energy, to power his own portal to the Nether-regions.
Once every thousand years, during the conjunction of space and time marked by the alignment, the dimension of the Great Old Ones touches ours.
They are as close as I am to you now and all around us.  We don't see Them, but, They, see us, in Their dark dreams.
And the portal of the Great Old Ones can be opened.  They can be summoned forth into our dimension. That is the power you possess."
<br/>"The tongues?"
<br/>"Yes. The tongues.  The tongues of the two sorcerers who divined the true nature of the elder portal."
<br/>"But, I'm not sure what to do."
<br/>"Fear not, young mage, the King will dispatch your orders soon enough.  I believe he is briefing a Draenei friend of yours, even as we speak."
<br/>"Krendal?"
<br/>"Indeed.  You are far from alone, my son.  You will enter battle with friends, brothers, sisters and the holy light that shines within and without you."
<br/>Wyl was happy and reassured that Krendal would be going with him to the citadel after all.
<br/>"Now," continued the Archbishop, "I must tend the flock.  May the light guide you."
</p>
<p>
The Archbishop and his attendants then walked up onto the knoll, from where he addressed the crowd around about.
<br/>"Brothers, sisters, we all know what tomorrow brings; a battle for civilization, a battle we thought we might fight for eternity and never win.
And yet, we have been given a second chance to finish it in mortal combat.  This is a rare gift indeed, in any lifetime.
Nevertheless, I know that some of you will be wondering: what's the point? We have been a long time dead and the world has moved on without us; we don't belong here in this time."
<br/>There was some murmuring amongst the crowd.
<br/>The Archbishop continued, "Well, the truth is, without another alignment and, indeed, without the great healer, Suzze,
there isn't enough manna in heaven to resurrect all of us who will fall tomorrow.  So, to any of you who would wish those offering resurrection to pass you by,
I offer you now, eternal salvation.  Come join with me, in the Guild of the Martyrs;  wear the Tabard of the Martyrs, as a sign that you wish to remain un-resurrected,
should you fall in battle, and let the spirit-healers guide you through limbo, to your seat of honour, at the Everlasting Feast of the Martyrs."
<br/>A trickle of people came forward and took a blessing from the Archbishop and a tabard from the attendants.  More soon followed.
<p>
Then Wyl heard a familiar voice behind him say, "Hello, friend."
<br/>Wyl spun around to see the big Draenei grinning down at him.
<br/>They embraced and patted each other on the back.
<br/>"So," Wyl said, "you fulfil your destiny after all!"
<br/>"And you too, perhaps?"
<br/>"So it would seem."
<br/>"I have our orders from the King."
<br/>"Indeed.  The Archbishop has explained something of our part."
<br/>"Well, I haven't eaten for a hundred years.  Are you hungry?"
<br/>"Me hungry?  Silly question!" Wyl laughed, "I hear there's a party on the beach; let's give that a try."
<br/>"Just lead me to it!" laughed Krendal.
